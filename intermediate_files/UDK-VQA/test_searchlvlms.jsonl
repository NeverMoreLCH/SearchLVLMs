It\u2019s here that she gets her start and eventually earns her first touring gig, which introduces her to many more ears, but also a darker view of the south and the temptation of drugs.

Avoid rooms where you might become trapped, such as the bathroom, or where you might be shut into a cupboard or other small space.

Laurus doesn't exactly physically interact with the characters of the manhwa early on in the story. Consequently, he comes off as weak and useless. However, in the final face-off between Yerenica and the God of the Underworld, Hades, with the obvious disadvantage for the good guys, Laurus makes his long-awaited appearance. With his innate powers of light and divinity pitted against the darkness embodied by Hades, a single divine intervention from Laurus proves more than enough for the former's instant demise. His win against Hades is almost unsettling because of how effortless it is. Furthermore, he wields the power to grant divine status to a mortal, demonstrated by his action of transforming Yerenica into a saintess..\n\nQuestion: What propels this Jazz singer's strength in a scarier world?\nAnswers:\nA.

There\u2019s so much more to the movie beyond the central romance. The Wizard of Oz himself, Frank Morgan, looms over the film as the hard, yet benevolent puppeteer behind the scenes. While the central lovers try and find their way to each other, Matuschek must wrestle with the potential that his love may be leaving him, as he suspects his wife is having an affair. It would be so easy for him to be painted as an angry, scorned man but instead Morgan brings forth his character\u2019s sadness. We are equally as invested in Matuschek\u2019s struggle to find the beauty in life and find love among those in the shop.

Love is on the mind, and it is the only thing that Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s \u201cBack to Black\u201d biopic wants the audience to ponder while witnessing Amy Winehouse\u2019s odyssey. Taylor-Johnson\u2019s biopic about the legendary jazz singer effectively portrays Winehouse as a being of love, both familial and romantic. As the film streams through its two-hour runtime, Winehouse becomes memorialized as a woman whose life was less so defined by what she created, than what she was bound to. The film wishes to build something pure and loving out of Winehouse\u2019s memory, but it ends up a lot less interesting than the music those memories inspired. The biopic has been hotly contested, particularly concerning its spectrum of authenticity and general purpose..\n\nQuestion: What propels this Jazz singer's strength in a scarier world?\nAnswers:\nA.

The directive is part of the Digital Services Act, which was published in October 2022 and gave companies until January 2024 to get into compliance. \"If we suspect a violation of the rules, we act. This is true at all times, but especially in times of democratic elections. Big digital platforms must live up to their obligations to put enough resources into this and today's decision shows that we are serious about compliance. \" An EC official said one example of a grievance against Meta was uncovered by AI forensics examining a Meta ad repository. The results led researchers to suspect mechanisms to identify and take action against foreign misinformation were not working properly. \"We are asking platforms to have sufficient quick reaction processes in place for these different threats, and in this particular case, I think they're not there,\" the official said. The investigation was one element of \"a complex of issues\" related to election integrity, suggesting the ad network was \"a soft target for foreign Russian actors. The company said it has since investigated, disrupted and blocked tens of thousands of the network\u2019s assets. The Facebook and Instagram owner says it remains on high alerts to monitor the network while claiming Doppelganger has struggled to successfully build organic audiences for the pro-Putin fake news.

(Meta) The European Commission\u2019s President said Meta\u2019s platforms, Facebook and Instagram, may have breached the Digital Services Act (DSA), the landmark legislation passed in 2022 that empowers the EU to regulate social platforms. The law allows the EC to, if necessary, impose heavy fines on violating companies \u2014 up to six percent of a company\u2019s global annual turnover, potentially changing how social companies operate. The European Commission said on Tuesday it is investigating Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) for a potential violation of the Digital Services Act on the grounds that it failed to rid Facebook and Instagram of \"deceptive advertisements and disinformation. \" The EC believes Meta is not complying with DSA obligations \"related to addressing the dissemination of deceptive advertisements, disinformation campaigns and coordinated inauthentic behavior in the EU. \" The investigation will also focus on political content and the lack of availability of an \"effective\" third-party real-time monitoring tool ahead of the upcoming European Parliament elections and other elections in the bloc. \"If we cannot be sure that we can trust content that we see online there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a risk that we end up not believing anything at all,\" European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Last week, the EC used the DSA to give TikTok 24 hours to explain the risk assessment procedures it used before launching a version of its app that rewards users for using it in certain ways. In December last year, X-formerly-Twitter became the first online platform to have formal DSA proceedings launched against it. An official said the investigation is ongoing and it has had \"quite intense contacts with X. \"\u00ae. We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Commission and providing them with further details of this work,\" a Meta spokesperson said, according to Reuters. We contacted Meta and will update this story if it has any further comment. Elon Musk's X platform is already under formal investigation for potential DSA violations. The law allows for fines of up to 6 percent of global revenue. Software technology trade groups are warning that companies could face \u201cinappropriate penalties\u201d under the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s proposed rule that would impose liability on firms with \u201cknowledge or reason to know\u201d that a customer will use their goods or services to perpetrate an impersonation scam. \u201cWhile this knowledge requirement may be intended to prevent strict liability against third parties who supply goods or services, we are concerned that it lacks sufficient clarity and could expose legitimate firms to inappropriate penalties,\u201d the Financial Technology Association has stated in comments to the FTC. If you\u2019ve recently found yourself staring at unfamiliar buttons and prompts on your favorite Meta apps, you\u2019re not alone. The recent rollout marks the debut of Meta AI\u2019s latest large language model, Llama 3, promising more personalized interactions but also potentially more intrusive AI suggestions. Still, this is the closest it has ever been to ChatGPT. But what if you\u2019re not ready to embrace the AI revolution? What if you find the integration more cumbersome than helpful? Maybe you hate that the answers are not completely reliable. But is there any way to turn off the new Meta AI integration and regain some semblance of your pre-AI browsing experience? While Meta has asserted that users cannot disable the AI, there are some tricks to minimize its presence, and we\u2019ll tell you all about them. Experts worry that new generative AI systems could be used to disrupt the many elections being held around the world this year, by supercharging the ability to spread disinformation at scale. The EU also suspects that Facebook and Instagram might be reducing the visibility in recommendation feeds of political content from accounts that pump out a lot of it - a practice known as shadowbanning - and not being transparent about it with users, which would violate the DSA. A third concern is Meta's decision to phase out Crowdtangle, a tool used by researchers, journalists and civil society groups for real-time monitoring of trending social media posts including during elections. The Commission is giving Meta five days to respond with information on how it will remedy the lack of such a tool.

Trump\u2019s attorneys have suggested that the payments were aimed at protecting his name and his family \u2014 not influencing the outcome of the presidential election. Jurors also began hearing from Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented McDougal and Daniels in their negotiations with the National Enquirer and Cohen. He testified that he arranged a meeting at his Los Angeles office during the summer of 2016 to see whether the tabloid's parent company American Media, Inc. was interested in McDougal\u2019s story. But the tabloid at the behest of publisher David Pecker eventually bought the rights, and Davidson testified that he understood \u2014 and McDougal preferred \u2014 it would never be published. Asked why American Media Inc. , would buy a story it didn\u2019t intend to run, Davidson said he was aware of two reasons. \u201cOne explanation I was given is they were trying to build Karen into a brand and didn\u2019t want to diminish her brand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the second was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn\u2019t run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump. Prosecutors allege that Cohen intended to use that account to transfer $125,000 to National Enquirer parent AMI for the rights to Playboy playmate Karen McDougal\u2019s story about an alleged affair with Trump, but the deal fell through after publisher David Pecker consulted with his attorneys. \u201cI am not going forward. It is a bad idea, and I want you to rip up the agreement,\u201d Pecker recounted telling Cohen. \u201cHe was very, very, angry. Very upset. Screaming, basically, at me. \u201d Ultimately, Farro said the account for Resolution Consultants LLC was never funded or opened by Cohen; prosecutors allege the account was abandoned along with the deal to reimburse AMI for the McDougal story. \" Prosecutors showed a text from Davidson in July 2016 that read: \"Don't forget about Cohen. Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia. \" He said on the stand that the text was \"regrettable,\" and that the phrase \"is not one that I use or came up with. \" Attorney Keith Davidson testifies at former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York as text messages from Dylan Howard are displayed on a screen on Tuesday, April 30, 2024. Jane Rosenberg Other texts showed Davidson negotiating through Howard, seeking a deal from AMI. He said he thought the outlet was a better fit, since the company wouldn't require McDougal to tell her story. Davidson indicated he understood that a deal with AMI would also benefit Trump for the same reason: McDougal's silence. Apr 30, 8:15 AM Michael Cohen\u2019s banker testified Friday about Cohen\u2019s LLCs On his first day on the stand Friday, banker Gary Farro told jurors that he was assigned to work with Michael Cohen in 2015 after one of Farro\u2019s colleagues left First Republic Bank, and that in October 2016 Cohen frantically attempted to open an account for a new business called Resolution Consultants LLC. Prosecutors allege that Cohen intended to use that account to transfer $125,000 to National Enquirer parent AMI for the rights to Playboy playmate Karen McDougal\u2019s story about an alleged affair with Trump, but the deal fell through after publisher David Pecker consulted with his attorneys. \u201cI am not going forward. It is a bad idea, and I want you to rip up the agreement,\u201d Pecker recounted telling Cohen. \u201cHe was very, very, angry. Very upset. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d Trump said in the video. Lastly, jurors sew a brief video of a press conference by President-elect Trump praising Michael Cohen. Trump, in one of the videos, appears to acknowledge how damaging the stories could have been to his election prospects. \u201cIf 5% of the people think its true, and maybe 10% of the people, we don\u2019t win,\u201d Trump says in the speech. In the courtroom, Trump\u2019s demeanor completely changed immediately after the videos were played for the jury. He perked up and frantically whispered with his attorney Todd Blanche, looking displeased. Browning, the C-SPAN executive, concluded his testimony, and defense lawyers opted not to cross-examine him. \" She told him her 10-month relationship with Trump was \"sexual in nature\" (which he denies). Davidson started shopping her story. He texted Enquirer Editor Dylan Howard in June 2016: \"I have a blockbuster Trump story. \" Howard responded: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. \"  THE ANTI-TRUMP MOVEMENT\u2019S SECRET ZOOM CALLS GIVE THEIR TARGET AMMO And: \"Did he cheat on Melania?\" Davidson was also pitching McDougal to ABC. He arranged a meeting with David Pecker\u2019s American Media Inc. , but the company declined, citing a lack of evidence. Later on, though, Davidson offered an AMI deal that would pay McDougal for fitness columns. \"She did not want to tell her story,\" the lawyer testified. \"She liked the AMI deal, which wouldn\u2019t force her to do that. \" Yep, we now know why. \u201d Davidson testified that he provided \u201clegal services\u201d to help the former Playmate negotiate with media outlets for the rights to her story about \u201ca personal interaction she had \u2014 allegedly had \u2014 with Donald Trump. \u201d \u201cAt the time \u2026 media outlets, both traditional and tabloid, would often enter into an exclusive arrangement where someone would provide exclusive content to that outlet in exchange for money,\u201d Davidson said. Davidson told Steinglass that he did not go behind McDougal\u2019s back when he arranged the agreement with AMI for the rights to her story Apr 30, 12:29 PM Prosecution calls former attorney for McDougal and Daniels Prosecutors called to the stand Keith Davidson, who worked as an attorney for both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels when the hush money payments to both women were arranged. CNN \u2014 Judge Juan Merchan handed down his first punishment to Donald Trump for violating the judge\u2019s gag order in the New York hush money trial Tuesday, fining Trump $9,000 for nine violations. The judge also warned the former president in his written order that continued violations could also lead to imprisonment \u2013 a striking reminder of the historic and surreal nature of this trial. Once the trial itself began Tuesday, jurors heard from the attorney who negotiated both the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal hush money agreements, Keith Davidson, who detailed his tribulations with Trump\u2019s then-fixer Michael Cohen in the final days of the 2016 campaign to get the money promised to Daniels for her to stay quiet.

Ecuador\u2019s counterclaim is that Glas was a fugitive wanted on corruption convictions and not for political reasons, and that therefore he was not eligible for Mexico\u2019s diplomatic protection.

He had just nine points on 2-of-8 shooting in the first half, but made 11 of 15 shots in the second half, including 6 of 7 from 3-point range, to vanquish the Suns. His soaring dunk in the fourth quarter was the exclamation point, but he also hit a deep 3 and blocked Devin Booker\u2019s shot at the rim, a jaw-dropping display of two-way force. When he was coming out of Georgia four years ago, Edwards heard questions about his motivation and his love of the game. All of those seem so silly now.

Timberwolves 122, Suns 116 Series: Timberwolves advance with 4-0 sweep Anthony Edwards shines over Suns Before the playoffs began last season against the Nuggets, Anthony Edwards was asked about being one of the league\u2019s young stars. He said that he couldn\u2019t be considered a young star yet because he had yet to win in the playoffs. Well, he\u2019s a young star now. A super one. 1 overall selection in 2020. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d Towns said before looking at Edwards. \u201cPlaying with my man on my right just makes it more special. To be able to do it with someone I have so much admiration for, so much respect for. \u201cThe future\u2019s so bright for him, I\u2019ve got to put my sunglasses on. \u201d The Suns swept the three-game, regular-season series from the Wolves, but Minnesota flipped that script in the postseason by wearing down a Phoenix team that had championship aspirations with their All-Star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. The 35-year-old Durant \u2014 who Edwards said was his favorite player growing up \u2014 offered nothing but praise for the young star. \u201cSo impressed with Ant,\u201d Durant said. \u201cMy favorite player to watch. In fact, he doesn't even know basketball basketball. However, the player nicknamed \"Ant Man\" is not at all reluctant to face Durant, who is 35 years old. Over the course of four games, Edwards was always able to outshine the players who were included in the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. He averaged 31 points, 8 rebounds and 6. 3 assists versus the Suns. AFP?CHRISTIAN PETERSEN Minnesota Timberwolves basketball player, Anthony Edwards (right), dribbles the ball in front of Phoenix Suns basketball player, Bradley Beal, in the fourth game of the first round of the NBA playoffs at the Footprint Center, Phoenix, Monday (29/4/2024) WIB. Edwards' star aura radiated even more after the match. He prepared something for his senior when they met again at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Both were selected for the United States national team. Beal possesses a massive contract that few, if any, teams would be willing to swallow, and he holds a no-trade clause that further restricts his value. Durant, 35, and Booker, 27, both suggested the Suns would run it back with their same core. Advertisement \u201cCommunication trumps all, and we weren\u2019t good at that this year,\u201d Booker said. \u201cHopefully everybody is feeling the same type of hurt. It has to be fixed. I have to be better. Kevin has to be better. Brad has to be better. Coach has to be better. \u201d To properly support Durant and Booker, Phoenix needs a distribution-minded point guard, two big wing defenders and a couple of proven frontcourt pieces besides Nurkic.

Edwards scored 31 of his points in the second half and finished 13 of 23 from the field, including 7 of 13 from 3-point range. Continuing his ascent into superstardom, the 22-year-old threw down a powerful, one-handed jam to give Minnesota a 115-111 lead with 2:14 left. Phoenix would never recover. The Wolves finished off the Suns despite Devin Booker\u2019s 49 points on 13 of 21 shooting. He also made 20 of 21 free throws. Kevin Durant added 33, but the rest of the team struggled. The Phoenix Suns began this season with Mat Ishbia saying they have the \u201cbest team\u201d in the NBA. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve got to play it out,\u201d the Suns team owner said on their media day back in October at Footprint Center. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited. \u201d On Sunday, their season of championship expectations ended much sooner than planned.

The eight-time All-Star was initially doubtful and said after Friday's loss he aggravated an Achilles injury late in the fourth quarter that had been bothering him since the regular-season finale against the Orlando Magic on April 14.

He played through that same injury on his way to 42 points in 41 minutes of action of Game 3 on Friday.

If Antetokounmpo and Lillard are unable to play Sunday, the Bucks will have to be careful with the ball and play with purpose, only taking the shots they want to and leaning into actions for their strongest offensive players. In a normal situation, instead of the end of a quarter, the Bucks would want to get into this action sooner to give Middleton time to deal with any extra attention, such as traps or double teams, that the Pacers might send his way, but this is a purposeful set. The Pacers have worked to deny Middleton the ball all series long, so one of the easiest ways to get him a touch is setting a screen. On the pass, Nesmith was able to scramble back to his original assignment, but the Bucks still managed to get Middleton the ball inside the arc with a live dribble in a place he could attack with good spacing around him. If the Bucks run something like that again on Sunday and get Middleton the ball in the same place, the Pacers will have tough decisions to make. If they let Middleton work in isolation, he showed the ability to score on Nesmith throughout Game 2. But if they send help, Middleton will be able to see the help in advance and find a teammate. Without Antetokounmpo and Lillard, their best creators, the Bucks will need to cut and screen with a purposeful end goal in mind on each possession. 7. Indiana Pacers The Pacers took a haymaker in the first half of Game 1 from Damian Lillard, but since then they have been the better team in this series. Pascal Siakam has been fantastic, Myles Turner has leveled up in terms of consistent two-way impact, and they have some absolute dogs for role players, headlined by Andrew Nembhard. The real question is whether Tyrese Haliburton can get it going as a scorer, because that\u2019s been what has held them back so far against Milwaukee. His game-winner in overtime of Game 3 maybe is the kind of thing that can get him going, and if so, this is a Pacers team that will, at least, be a difficult out in any series. 6. Even though Lillard finished Friday's game with 28 points, he didn't attempt a shot and was scoreless in the overtime period. Khris Middleton was listed as doubtful going into the game with an ankle injury, but he was able to suit up and finished with a playoff career-high 42 points. The Bucks have already had to play the first three games in this series without Antetokounmpo due to a calf strain. They cruised to victory in Game 1, but dropped the next two games. Rivers will have to find ways to piece together a rotation that can generate offense without his top two scorers. Middleton is going to be the engine for everything, but their role players have to step up. If Donovan Mitchell wants to be THAT GUY then he has to step up in moments like the second half of this game and put the team on his back. Mitchell knows it, too. Here's his postgame quote, via Joe Varden of The Athletic. \"I have to be better \u2026 it's simple,\" Mitchell said. \"Those games we've lost, I haven't been myself. \u2026 As much of the success I get, I deserve the criticism, too, and I hold myself to that. My teammates probably hate that I'm saying it, but it's just a fact. I can't have 18 points in the first half and zero in the second, on four shots. \u00bb READ MORE: Joel Embiid finally discovers he has the DNA of a champion. Down 2-1, can he lead the Sixers past the Knicks? Some good news?

If they let Middleton work in isolation, he showed the ability to score on Nesmith throughout Game 2. But if they send help, Middleton will be able to see the help in advance and find a teammate. Without Antetokounmpo and Lillard, their best creators, the Bucks will need to cut and screen with a purposeful end goal in mind on each possession. 7. Indiana Pacers The Pacers took a haymaker in the first half of Game 1 from Damian Lillard, but since then they have been the better team in this series. Pascal Siakam has been fantastic, Myles Turner has leveled up in terms of consistent two-way impact, and they have some absolute dogs for role players, headlined by Andrew Nembhard. The real question is whether Tyrese Haliburton can get it going as a scorer, because that\u2019s been what has held them back so far against Milwaukee. His game-winner in overtime of Game 3 maybe is the kind of thing that can get him going, and if so, this is a Pacers team that will, at least, be a difficult out in any series. 6. Saturday night, both Reaves and D'Angelo Russell stepped up with 21 points and \"kept the scoreboard moving,\" borrowing a Darvin Ham phrase.

If Antetokounmpo and Lillard are unable to play Sunday, the Bucks will have to be careful with the ball and play with purpose, only taking the shots they want to and leaning into actions for their strongest offensive players. In a normal situation, instead of the end of a quarter, the Bucks would want to get into this action sooner to give Middleton time to deal with any extra attention, such as traps or double teams, that the Pacers might send his way, but this is a purposeful set. The Pacers have worked to deny Middleton the ball all series long, so one of the easiest ways to get him a touch is setting a screen. A major difference in Saturday's win was the contributions of Los Angeles' role players. D'Angelo Russell stepped up and had 21 points and Austin Reaves put up 21 as well.

Tennessee Titans Reaches across the board for the Tennessee Titans. JC Latham is a fine player, but taking him over Penn State's Olu Fashanu and Georgia's Amarius Mims is a bold, bold move for the Titans. Then reaching on a nose tackle who was just arrested for a DWI two weeks before the draft with pick No. 39 was an even bolder move. In fact, outside of fourth round pick Cedric Gray it is hard to find a player in their class that will make an impact in the first two years of their careers on Day 3 of their draft. For a team entering a new era with a new head coach, this draft still leaves then a year or so away from being competitive. Stacy Revere/Getty Images The Atlanta Falcons made a bold move in the NFL draft by taking Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 pick. The move was somewhat puzzling considering the Falcons recently signed quarterback Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million deal. If Cousins plays out the entirety of that deal, Penix likely won't see action as a starter for several more years. The Falcons compared the pick to what the Green Bay Packers did when they selected Jordan Love in the first round of the 2020 NFL draft to be a backup to Aaron Rodgers, but NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah said that is an \"apples to oranges\" comparison. \"They came out and used the Green Bay model as their explanation,\" Jeremiah said on the Pat McAfee Show. Joe Robbins/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images The Atlanta Falcons' decision to select former Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 pick in the 2024 NFL draft was a surprise to many, including members of opposing NFL front offices. \"The Penix move turned the draft on its head,\" an anonymous front office member said, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. \"The room perked up after that selection. \" While the 23-year-old was coming off a tremendous season with the Huskies, the Falcons' 2024 quarterback room was seemingly set before the draft started. Atlanta signed former Minnesota Vikings signal-caller Kirk Cousins to a massive four-year deal worth $180 million in free agency, which included a $50 million signing bonus and $100 million guaranteed (via Spotrac). Penix was viewed as a quarterback that could contribute quickly ahead of the draft, as he completed 65. The New England Patriots made some noise in the fourth round of the NFL draft by using a pick they got in a trade with the Los Angeles Chargers on former UCF star receiver Javon Baker. After failing to land a true No. 1 veteran receiving target, the Patriots set their eyes on the draft to upgrade the skilled positions around their new rookie quarterback, Drake Maye. Baker is an explosive playmaker capable of working both outside and inside. He\u2019s also tremendous in contested catch situations. Just one look at his highlight reel is enough to see why some are so excited about his potential.

Atlanta now has two years of contract control for Pitts. Some may question why it seems logical to pick up the rookie option on Pitts considering most feel he has yet to live up to his lofty-draft status. The Falcons made Pitts the highest-drafted tight end in history when they took him No. 4 overall in 2021. Arizona's had a 4-13 record in each of the past two seasons. Ossenfort chose to use the No. 4 pick instead of trading down for potentially more selections. It was a different strategy from his first season with the club, when the Cardinals started with the No. 3 overall selection but made multiple trades on draft night before settling on the No. 6 pick, which was used to select offensive lineman Paris Johnson Jr. Johnson \u2014 who also played at Ohio State \u2014 started all 17 games at right tackle last season. Harrison said the two have texted back and forth over the past few months, excited about the possibility of playing together. Harrison should also have an immediate impact, especially considering the Cardinals lack of elite receivers. He's the son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison, though considerably bigger than his dad, possessing a rare combination of size, speed and athleticism. He caught 67 passes for 1,211 yards and 14 touchdowns in his final season with the Buckeyes.

Arizona took Harrison, who has drawn comparisons to Larry Fitzgerald and Robinson, who had 8. 5 sacks last season, in the first round of the NFL Draft on Thursday. Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video TEMPE, Ariz. \u2014 Arizona Cardinals general manager Monti Ossenfort played riverboat gambler in his first draft last season, wheeling and dealing picks during the first round at a dizzying pace. This time around, he didn't need to get fancy. The Cardinals selected receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. with the No. 4 overall pick in the NFL draft on Thursday night, hoping the Ohio State star can be the team's leading playmaker for quarterback Kyler Murray. \u201cKyler\u2019s awesome,\u201d Harrison said. 0 million. It seems odd that a rookie contract is slotted to where a player is drafted, but the fifth-year option on that contract is tied to his position. It works out for the Falcons though. Pitts was a Pro Bowler his rookie season with Matt Ryan as his quarterback. He struggled with injuries and inconsistent quarterback play in 2022 and 2023. He's still just 23-years old, 5-months younger than Atlanta's first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. , and still oozes talent and upside. $10. 9 million is a relatively cheap gamble for the Falcons to take on his fully-guaranteed option year. They'll have a decision to make on Drake London next year. London has yet to make a Pro Bowl, but he'll easily make the playing time bonus.

One of the most notable people in NFL media believe they won the 2024 draft.

B/R's NFL Scouting Department ranked him as the top overall player on its latest big board, and he figures to be the No. 1 wide receiver as soon as his rookie season for the Cardinals. ESPN\u2019s Jordan Reid pegged Suamataia\u2019s selection as his favorite pick of the draft, citing Kansas City\u2019s ability to trust young offensive linemen to perform well early in their careers. \u201cI\u2019m going with an under-the-radar move here. In the aforementioned deep offensive tackle class, Suamataia got a bit lost in the shuffle. But he ultimately landed in the perfect spot in Kansas City,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThe Chiefs have a huge need at left tackle, and they don\u2019t shy away from playing offensive linemen early; they saw near-immediate success from Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith on the interior. So, Suamataia has the potential to contribute as a rookie. He has exciting traits, including lower-half suddenness, and certainly could develop into a dependable starter..\n\nQuestion: Who did this NFL team select with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2024 draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

While many still held doubts about this Thunder team heading into the postseason, the young guys continued to block out the noise and play their brand of basketball. On Monday night, Oklahoma City took down a determined New Orleans Pelicans team in Game 4, completing the series sweep and advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals. A 97-89 victory led by 24 points apiece from Jalen Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Thunder defense stood tall yet again and forced the Pelicans to under 38% from the field and 24% from three, capping off an impressive defensive run versus some talented Pelicans scorers. This now paves the way for Oklahoma City to be seriously looked at as a contender, but they'll still have to prove that to the skeptics who are unconvinced of their inexperience. Facing either the L.

Obviously, JV (Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas) gave him some fits down there at times, but you always have to be aware of where he is at. He has a very bright future. \u201d On the 2023-24 season coming to an end:. Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty Images Amid the shift that happened in the Western Conference this season with multiple new teams finishing at the top of the standings, two clubs looking to make their mark could be big factors in the trade market over the summer. Per The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor, the New Orleans Pelicans and Utah Jazz are expected \"to be aggressive in pursuing trades this summer with their mountains of picks. \" Trying to keep up in the Western Conference right for a team that's not currently in the top tier is a difficult test. The Oklahoma City Thunder had the best record in the conference during the regular season with a roster. They accomplished that feat with the second-youngest roster in the league when the season started. The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 season ended on Monday night with a 108-106 loss to the Denver Nuggets in Game 5 of their Western Conference first-round playoff series, which has resulted in plenty of tough questions about the team\u2019s future. It already looks like Darvin Ham might not be back as the team\u2019s head coach. But what about LeBron James? Will he be back? James was asked in his news conference after the Game 5 loss whether this was his last game with the Lakers. He smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that. \u201d. \u201d He also praised Williamson\u2019s season where the young star played a career-high 70 games. \u201cI think you saw so much evolution in his game that came from the evolution (of) his body and the work he put in,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about where Zion is and where he intends to go. \u201d David Griffin on Zion's season pic. twitter. com/QNA4PcrcEn \u2014 New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) April 30, 2024 Despite the frustrating end, Griffin pointed to stretches of the season when the Pelicans looked like one of the best teams in the league, specifically mentioning that they had the best road record in the NBA and the sixth-best net rating. If Griffin does intend to improve New Orleans\u2019 roster through trades, such an avenue could involve a deal sending out Brandon Ingram, who is entering the final year of his contract in 2024-25. If the Pelicans won 49 games last season, they would\u2019ve been the No. 3 seed. This year, they won 49 games and almost missed the playoffs. With so many teams positioned to be playoff contenders for the foreseeable future, complacency is the easiest way to be on the outside looking in. The 10th-seeded Golden State Warriors won 46 games this year and teams like the Houston Rockets, Memphis Grizzlies and San Antonio Spurs are all expected to make significant jumps next year. The Pelicans have to be aggressive if they hope to jump into the upper echelon of the conference with Oklahoma City, the Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets. Do I think this means Ingram or CJ McCollum will be on the move this summer? I don\u2019t necessarily buy that. This was the first season Williamson, 23, played more than 61 games, and he flashed MVP-level dominance. Williamson averaged 22. 9 points, 5. 8 rebounds, and 5. 0 assists before he was injured in the play-in tournament with 3:19 left in a 40-point outburst against the Lakers. He called the injury \"super-demoralizing. \" Griffin discussed expectations placed on Williamson at his 2023 season-ending news conference when he felt Brandon Ingram was having an All-NBA season with a dominant finish to the regular season while Williamson nursed an injury. Griffin didn't indicate he'd rather part with either player. But with Trey Murphy, Herb Jones and Naji Marshall in the fold as primarily wing players, the Pelicans could be in position to consider a trade from a position of strength..\n\nQuestion: What did executive vice president David Griffin hint at in regards to this NBA team's future?\nAnswers:\nA.

Kane went closest with a free kick before the break, awarded for a foul by Nacho on Jamal Musiala, who gingerly rubbed his bandaged left leg. The Germany forward had only just recovered from a knee problem. San\u00e9 equalized in the 53rd when he ran at the Madrid defense and cut inside Ferland Mendy before firing a fierce strike just inside the near post. Kane made it 2-1 four minutes later with a penalty awarded after Lucas V\u00e1zquez bundled over Musiala. But it wasn\u2019t the last penalty as Kim Min-jae \u2014 who was beaten on Vin\u00edcius\u2019 first goal \u2014brought down Rodrygo. Vin\u00edcius duly equalized from the spot. \u201cIt was a back-and-forth game,\u201d Bayern midfielder Konrad Laimer said. Vinicius Jr grabbed the ball and slotted home the penalty to send the two teams to next week\u2019s second leg on level terms. Harry Kane stepped up and slotted home the penalty to turn the tie around and see the hosts go 2-1 up in the blink of an eye. Munich\u2019s English duo Harry Kane and Eric Dier almost added more goals to the scoreboard shortly afterwards; the home team were attacking in waves whilst their visitors were just hanging in there. Madrid would just about keep the scoreline at 2-1 though, and with just over 10 minutes remaining Vinicius might have scored again. Moments later though, Vinicius and Madrid would have an even better chance to equalise. Again defender Kim was at fault for Bayern; conceding a penalty by bringing down Rodrygo. Real Madrid had done a Real Madrid, seemingly on the ropes but they came back with a killer blow of their own. Vini Jr made it all level from the spot. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich played out a thrilling first leg of their Champions League semi-final, which stands all square ahead of a mouthwatering return game in the Spanish capital. There were as many awful defensive errors as there were impeccably crafted goals in this 2-2 draw, broken open by Vinicius Jr\u2019s first-half strike before a rapid turnaround engineered by Leroy Sane and Harry Kane. Vinicius then struck a late penalty to level up. Bayern started the brighter team and Sane, fit along with the sparky Jamal Musiala after injury, tested Andriy Lunin with a low shot inside the first two minutes. Kane\u2019s audacious attempt from the halfway line joined further efforts from Musiala and Sane before Real managed any of their own but Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team kept a cool head to gently work their way back into proceedings. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti says the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u stadium could hold the secret to reaching the Champions League final this season, after Los Blancos drew 2-2 against Bayern Munich in the semifinal first leg on Tuesday. The result in Germany means the tie is perfectly poised going into the return leg in Spain on May 8, and Ancelotti hopes the home support can help his team get over the line. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see the best Real Madrid today,\u201d he told reporters after the game. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we see it in the second leg. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough because we\u2019re playing against a great team and the tie is evenly balanced, but the fans are going to help us in the second leg for sure. \u201d After taking the lead through Vin\u00edcius Jr. MUNICH (AP) \u2014 Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior scored twice for Real Madrid to draw 2-2 at Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal on Tuesday. Bayern dominated but Madrid survived, and the contest is still wide open ahead of the return leg in Madrid on May 8. With the focus on England stars Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham, as well as Toni Kroos\u2019 return to his former team, Vin\u00edcius emerged as the decisive figure on a night when his bright green boots were often a blur. The Brazil forward opened the scoring against the run of play in the 24th minute and equalized with a coolly taken penalty in the 83rd after Leroy San\u00e9 and Kane had scored for Bayern. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good result,\u201d said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, who led Bayern to the Bundesliga title in 2017. Having had six shots and over 60% possession in the first 20 minutes - the best of the chances falling to Sane and Kane - Bayern were behind against the run of play. But a ruthless four-minute period in the second half turned the game around and the German giants regained their momentum. They put Real under pressure and were perhaps unfortunate not to have extended their lead. Kim's mistake - a needless tug on Rodrygo's shirt in the 83rd minute - allowed Real back into the game and they return to the Bernabeu Stadium with home advantage in next Wednesday's second leg. MICHAELA STACHE/AFP via Getty Images Somehow, someway, Real Madrid always gets the job done in Europe. The Spanish giant played to a 2-2 draw with Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal tie. Having already scored the opener, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior delivered the equalizer from the penalty spot in the 83rd minute. It was a moment that encapsulated the sense of inevitability that hangs over Madrid in this competition. Regardless of how the club is performing on a given night or across a season, this is where it thrives. Vin\u00edcius scored with Real Madrid's first shot of the game and there was no doubt he'd rise to the occasion to square things up at two goals apiece. Bayern Munich is probably equal parts encouraged and disappointed with how the first leg unfolded. \u201cNow it's time to have a magical night at home. \u201d Watch Vinicius Jr penalty to level the tie 21:54 , Marc Mayo A crisp finish to make it 2-2.

Lionel Messi is dangerously closing in on Cristiano Ronaldo to get one of the most impressive records of all time. Lionel Messi had another spectacular game with Inter Miami, scoring two goals in his team\u2019s victory against New England Revolution. At the moment, the Argentine legend is the leading candidate to be the Most Valuable Player of the 2024 MLS season. Despite playing only seven games due to several injury problems, Messi has already scored nine goals and provided seven assists. Playing three games less than Cristian Arango, he has already surpassed the Colombian star as the top scorer of the tournament. Considering this scenario, comparisons are inevitable with the other great veteran who continues to shine on the other side of the world: Cristiano Ronaldo..\n\nQuestion: Who is chasing one of this Footballer's greatest records?\nAnswers:\nA.

McNeeley, who was described by 247's Adam Finkelstein as having, \u201cone of the best combinations of skill and basketball acumen in the national class,\u201d should theoretically fit like a glove in a UConn system that has been carefully crafted by head coach Dan Hurley and his staff. And as he announced his decision, McNeeley explained that Connecticut's system was a big reason why he chose the Huskies over Indiana \u2014 where McNeeley originally committed \u2014 Kansas, and Texas, among other schools. \u201cIt felt like a perfect fit,\u201d McNeeley said, according to Jonathan Givony of ESPN. com. \u201cCoach Hurley is a hard-nosed coach. That's the kind of coach I thrive under. Other standout offensive statistics for Brea include a 71. 5% effective field goal percentage (second in the nation last season) and a 72. 2% true shooting percentage (also second in the nation last season). He attempted more than six 3-pointers per game. This shooting prowess would marry well with Pope\u2019s offensive style of play. The former BYU and Utah Valley head coach is known for making good use of analytics with his teams\u2019 shot diets: Last season, BYU finished second nationally with 32 long-range attempts per game and the Cougars were 14th in the nation in offensive efficiency, per KenPom. According to college basketball statistician Evan Miyakawa, Brea is ranked as the No. 79 overall transfer portal player, as of Monday evening. He is the second Husky to enter the portal following the back-to-back title, with Greek sophomore Apostolos Roumoglou making the same decision on April 19. The last day for players to enter the portal is Wednesday. Liam McNeeley officially signs NLI Class of 2024 commit Liam McNeeley, who announced his commitment to UConn on Friday, officially signed his National Letter of Intent on Tuesday. \u201cLiam is one of the best players in high school basketball, and we are tremendously excited to add him to our UConn family,\u201d Hurley said in a team release. \u201cHe is blessed with elite skill and positional size, along with the championship pedigree that we so value at Connecticut. Liam has the potential to be a star here. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I was most excited for, getting all that other stuff out of the way,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe draft was amazing, New York City was amazing, Los Angeles was amazing, but I was excited to get here and get back to playing basketball, you know, doing my job. \u201d All focus when Clark takes the court will be on her ability to shoot the ball from virtually anywhere, but head coach Christie Sides loves another part of her game that strikes fear into opponents. \u201cHer ability to space the floor for us is just incredible,\u201d Sides explained after running practice, where Clark was running with the starters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have five players on the court that can shoot it, but her passing ability \u2013 you saw some of the passes she made. Sophomore Andre Johnson Jr. shot his shot near the end of UConn\u2019s win over Northwestern in the second round of the 2024 NCAA Tournament. And he made the garbage-time 3-point attempt, extending the lead to 19 with 30 seconds left. The bench was thrilled for the walk-on from Bristol, who hadn\u2019t scored in his two seasons with the Huskies. Dan Hurley wasn\u2019t \u2013 Northwestern head coach Chris Collins is a long-time friend and someone he didn\u2019t want to disrespect. That will go down as the only shot Johnson made in his two-year career in Storrs, which was played largely in garbage time minutes and saw the South Kent alum only attempt three shots, all from beyond the arc. He decided to enter the transfer portal on Tuesday. Apr. 30\u2014UConn officially welcomed Liam McNeeley to the program and announced that veteran guard Hassan Diarra will return next season on Tuesday. Coach Dan Hurley talked about McNeeley, who signed a National Letter of Intent, for the first time since receiving a commitment from the five-star recruit on Friday.

Max\u2019s brutal suicide makes for a shocking conclusion that speaks to the way violence continues to permeate. Max\u2019s story is sadly one of many; Videodrome feeds off of the subjugation and seduction of easily corruptible people. Videodrome's ending sees Max literally transform into a weapon, as the program has corrupted his mind and forced him to shed his human shell. The grotesque way that his body envelops suggests that by sacrificing himself to Videodrome, Max has become a tool within the program's continued reign. Max slits his stomach in a way that resembles a VHS player; in this way, Cronenberg implies that he has become more machine than human. The film is terrifying not just because of the violent nature of Max\u2019s demise, but for how it tracks how a character like him could gradually become part of a mind control conspiracy. Unlike other protagonists in Cronenberg's films, Max is initially willing to subjugate himself to Videodrome's influence and understands only too late that he's no longer in control of his thoughts. In 1983, Videodrome was a breakthrough work of imaginative horror; today, its commentary on the way that violent extremist groups garner new members is horrifically prescient. Videodrome is available to rent on Amazon. Rent on Amazon. The Big Picture Body horror genre explores violent distortion of human form, forcing viewers to reflect on self-image. David Cronenberg\u2019s Videodrome delves into media indoctrination and extremism, showcasing loss of reality. Max's descent into obsession in Videodrome culminates in his gruesome transformation, a chilling reflection of societal manipulation. Body horror cinema is among the most disturbing and potentially upsetting subgenres of horror. Unlike slasher or paranormal films in which an exterior threat is responsible for terror, the body horror genre frequently features the violent and grotesque contortion of the human body. By violating an identifiable aspect of the human experience, great works of body horror can force their viewers to think critically about the way they view themselves. Although the subgenre has many great innovators, no one has contributed more to body horror than the Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg. Realizing that he is a pawn in a larger political movement, Max desperately tries to free himself from Videodrome\u2019s influence. The film's most disturbing moment comes when Max completely forsakes his humanity; after being brainwashed by a Betamax tape inserted into his body by Convex, Max ruthlessly murders his former coworkers and attempts to attack his love interest Bianca O'Blivion (Sonja Smith). This is an extremely upsetting ending because it shows that Max has completely lost any sense of individuality; he has become yet another faceless drone whose singular motivation is to recreate the footage he sees through Videodrome.

However, there's only one Marvel Studios movie in 2024: Deadpool & Wolverine. And according to director Shawn Levy, you won't need to watch any previous MCU show or movie to enjoy the sequel. \"I was a good student in school,\" related Levy during an interview with the Associated Press. \"I'll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies. I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn't want to presume that. This movie is built for entertainment, with no obligation to come prepared with prior research. \" Levy emphasized the priority when making Deadpool & Wolverine was to create a movie that viewers, no matter what level they are coming in at, would enjoy. \"Audiences are hungry for a great time at the movies,\" Levy said. \"They want to be delighted, transported, and entertained. And when they are given that, whether it's Barbie, Oppenheimer, or any number of other recent movies, they show up. The movie is built for audience delight. I think [they're] in for a very fun ride. \" While studying is not essential, it might score a few extra points. (Image credit: Sony Pictures Releasing) 24. Baby Driver In the very first sequence in Edgar Wright\u2019s Baby Driver, everything, and I mean everything, is timed to the song \u201cBellbottoms\u201d by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and the the audience is immediately swept into Baby\u2019s world. It's a world that\u2019s driven by music, and Wright\u2019s ability to make us feel like we\u2019re literally wearing the protagonist\u2019s headphones through the bumping soundtrack and immaculately timed action is masterful. While this film is not technically a musical, music is its driving force speeding us through Baby\u2019s journey that delivers heart-pounding car chases, lovely romantic moments and a stunning shootout timed to the song \u201cTequila. \u201d (Image credit: Netflix) 23. Wade Wilson decides to officially retire Deadpool and becomes a used car salesman. \u201cBut when his friends, family, and the whole world are at stake, Deadpool decides to bring his katanas out of retirement. He recruits an unwilling and wary Wolverine to not only fight for their survival but ultimately, their legacy. \" It\u2019s also explained: \"That f\u2013king irresponsible hero Deadpool will change the history of the MCU with Wolverine!?\" Shawn Levy is directing the movie and the confirmed cast for the movie includes Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, Morena Baccarin and Stefan Kapicic as Vanessa and Colossus, Matthew Macfadyen as a TVA Agent, and Leslie Uggams as Blind Al. They are joined by Brianna Hildebrand and Shioli Kutsuna, who will also return to the franchise as Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Negasonic Teenage Warhead\u2019s girlfriend Yukio. Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy has said people do not need to do any Marvel Cinematic Universe \"homework\" before watching the upcoming superhero movie. The latest trailer for Deadpool & Wolverine featured plenty of action, a few familiar faces, and a clever callback to an early Spider-Man film, butLevy has assured audiences that he has made Deadpool's third outing accessible to everyday cinemagoers as much as hardcore MCU fans, meaning no \"prior research\" is required. \"I was a good student in school. I'll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies,\" Levy told the Associated Press. I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies. And when they are given that, whether it\u2019s 'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer' or any number of other recent movies, they show up. \" \"The movie is built for audience delight.

The movie is written by Ryan Reynolds & Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick & Zeb Wells & Shawn Levy. Deadpool & Wolverine is one of the most anticipated films of the year. But do fans need to watch all the previous Marvel films and come prepared with the existing MCU knowledge? Director Shawn Levy does not believe so. In a new interview with Associated Press, the director said that there is \u2018no obligation to come prepared with prior research\u2019 for this film.

Sometimes, they make major improvements (that's the hope for Captain America: Brave New World this summer, for example), and other times. not so much. Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania's new ending may prove that. Regardless, Deadpool & Wolverine is also currently undergoing reshoots. According to scooper Daniel Richtman, these are expected to last until May, leaving plenty of time before the threequel's planned July release. Based on the cameos added to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness during its reshoots, brace yourselves for surprises which haven't been leaked or alluded to by the usual social media scoopers. Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy recently caught up with Associated Press and opened up on his approach to a team-up fans have spent literally decades dreaming about seeing on screen. So. of all the final things you could say to someone you adore, that's a little scrap of consolation I'll hang onto forever. In addition to Deadpool & Wolverine, Chan worked on more than half a dozen Marvel projects, including Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Infinity War, and The Falcon & the Winter Soldier.

In the third quarter, the Eagles scored their third consecutive goal to notch their first lead of the game. Twenty-two minutes separated Syracuse\u2019s seventh goal scored by Gracie Britton and its eighth goal scored by Ward at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Throughout SU\u2019s scoreless stretch, Boston College flipped a 7-5 deficit into a 10-7 lead. While the Orange still had time to come back after Ward\u2019s goal brought them back within two, no such thing happened. Martello tormented SU\u2019s defense, notching her fifth and sixth goals, consecutively, to give BC a 12-8 lead with 8:53 left. Sweitzer also scored and Ward found the net on a free position to provide the Orange a 5-1 advantage with 4:14 left in the first quarter. The Eagles answered with four-consecutive goals over the next eight minutes to knot things up, 5-5. Four different performers got on the board \u2014 Rachel Clark from a free position, Emma LaPinto and Davis in transition, and Martello. The two combatants split the remaining four goals of the half. Emma Tyrell ended a Syracuse scoreless streak of 10:46 with a shovel shot, followed by Gracie Britton\u2019s fourth goal of the season. The Eagles earned tallies from Martello, during a woman-up situation at 1:45, and Emma LaPinto with 30 seconds left in the second quarter. Boston College won the regular-season matchup between the two rivals 10 days ago, 11-10 in overtime in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. \u201d Cassidy Weeks then put the game away for the Eagles, winning the draw control and rolling around through the middle before firing the ball past Sweitzer. LoPinto and Molly Driscoll added two more goals for the Eagles while their defense continued to lock down the Orange, en route to a 15\u20138 win and a second straight ACC championship. \u201cI think one of the gifts of the team is that they play for each other,\u201d Walker-Weinstein said. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing individually or for individual goals, they\u2019re playing for each other. \u201d Now, the Eagles look ahead to the NCAA Tournament selection show and shift focus toward lifting a second trophy this year. \u201cOnce we get back to practice next week, we\u2019re kind of closing this chapter,\u201d Scales said. \u201cWe\u2019re onto the next, taking it each game at a time, and not taking anything for granted. \u201cWe two had transition goals that were great,\u201d Martello said. \u201cBut then [Walker-Weinstein] brought us in and said like those goals are great, you got the momentum, and now we\u2019re looking for layups. \u201d BC\u2019s defense settled down after the early push from Syracuse with stronger marking, active sticks, and getting back to their strengths, according to Sydney Scales. \u201cFocusing on just getting back to those basics which were one v. ones and communication, and once we did that everything else fell into place,\u201d Scales said. Martello tied the game at 5\u20135 after receiving a pass from Davis while cutting through the middle. But the Orange restored its one-goal lead when Emma Tyrrell shoveled a shot past Dolce even while surrounded by BC defenders. The Orange added another just 36 seconds later to give Syracuse a 7\u20135 lead. Before the start of the season, Boston College lacrosse head coach Acacia Walker-Weinstein made her goals crystal clear. \u201cThe expectation is to win another conference championship and national championship,\u201d Walker-Weinstein said. Now, step one is complete with the Eagles winning back-to-back ACC titles behind a four-goal first-half comeback. The Eagles (16\u20133, 7\u20132 Atlantic Coast) withstood an early push from Syracuse (14\u20135, 8\u20131) before scoring 10 of the last 11 goals to beat the Orange 15\u20138 on Sunday afternoon in Charlotte, N. C. \u201cObviously you don\u2019t want to go down,\u201d Kayla Martello said. \u201cBut being able to come back from that and then winning back to back is an amazing feeling. And we\u2019re just so proud. \u201d The Orange struck quickly, with Natalie Smith firing it past Shea Dolce just 13 seconds into the game. To overcome their recent postseason failures, the Orange had to get through the team they haven\u2019t beaten under Treanor: Boston College. But for the sixth straight game, No. 4 Syracuse (14-5, 8-1 ACC) fell 15-8 to No. 3 Boston College (16-3, 7-2 ACC) in the ACC Tournament title game. SU led 5-1 with four minutes left in the first quarter, yet the Orange were silenced over the final 49 minutes as they were outscored 14-3. \u201cWe\u2019re just really frustrated because we really did not play the way we\u2019ve been playing,\u201d Treanor said postgame. As the Orange looked to win their first ACC Tournament since Treanor netted a game-winner as a player versus North Carolina in 2015, it\u2019s only fitting that the Eagles handed them the loss. Senior attacker Morgan Schwab got the Cavaliers on the board early in the second quarter when freshman attacker Madison Alaimo feinted a dodge and picked out Schwab on the crease for a finish in the top left corner. However, this would be the last time that Virginia added to the scoreboard during the first half. Tyrell completed a first-half hat trick, and freshman midfielder Joely Caramelli, senior attacker Emma Ward and senior midfielder Maddy Baxter all added to their totals for the Orange. A 13-1 halftime deficit was indicative of the Cavaliers\u2019 first half struggles, and Syracuse had begun to run away with the victory. The Orange scored again just 16 seconds into the third quarter thanks to senior midfielder Natalie Smith. The Irish pressed on with their rally from there, but Eagles goalkeeper Shea Dolce made three saves to send Boston College to the championship game. In that championship game, the Eagles would defeat Syracuse by a 15-8 score on Sunday. Notre Dame now looks ahead to the NCAA Tournament, which begins Friday, May 10. The Irish will learn their first opponent and destination during the selection show at 9 p. m. Sunday, May 5. The two continued to trade blows, with Payton Cormier opening up the scoring in the second for Virginia before Chris Kavanagh connected with the team\u2019s leading goal-scorer, graduate student Jake Taylor, for his first of the day. Cormier would grab his second before the end of another relatively low-scoring quarter, taking a 6-4 lead into half for the Cavaliers. As brilliant as both teams are on offense, the half was defined by the play of graduate student Liam Entenmann for Notre Dame and Matthew Nunes for Virginia, arguably the two best shot-stoppers in college lacrosse. Both netminders made an incredible eight saves in the half. Virginia controlled the opening draw of the third quarter, which led to Cormier\u2019s hat trick goal, opening up the biggest lead of the day for either team. Sophomore midfielder Max Busenkell scored the next goal before the Irish capitalized on a man-up opportunity to tie the game at seven. Junior attackman and man-up specialist Jeffery Ricciardelli got the goal for an Irish man-up unit that has been lethal all season. Taylor\u2019s second of the day gave Notre Dame their first lead since the first quarter. With 30 seconds remaining in the quarter, Virginia would have the opportunity to show the prowess of their man-up unit. Aided by the man advantage, Cormier tallied his fourth of the day to tie the game heading into the fourth. Virginia took a 9-8 lead after a long-range shot from Ryan Colsey. For the remainder of the quarter, however, the Cavalier offense would fail to score again..\n\nQuestion: Who did this University lose to in the ACC Tournament title game?\nAnswers:\nA. Treanor\nB.

After a 9-7 loss to the Eagles in Friday\u2019s ACC semifinals, the Irish have now seen four tournament runs end at the hands of Boston College in the last four seasons. Last year, the Eagles eliminated Notre Dame in both the ACC and NCAA Championships. This year\u2019s game represented a rematch of Notre Dame\u2019s epic win at Chestnut Hill on March 16. The Irish scored late to beat the Eagles 15-14, winning at Chestnut Hill for the first time in two decades. That nail-biter marked the second victory of a 10-game win streak that carried Notre Dame into Friday\u2019s matchup. With the game\u2019s opening draw, one of Notre Dame\u2019s top players immediately made history. Syracuse finally regained momentum to take a 7-5 lead at the 5:30 mark of the second quarter, but BC responded with two goals to tie the game 7-7 before halftime.

After Syracuse scored twice more, Schwab once again picked out senior defender Maggie Bostain with five seconds left to play. The fourth quarter scoring began with three consecutive free-position shots that were dispatched coolly \u2014 two for the Orange and one for Virginia. Syracuse scored one last time late in the final period to end the game with a shocking 19-4 scoreline. Ultimately, a forgettable first half performance sunk the ship for the Cavaliers. Usual standout sophomore goaltender Mel Josephson being benched during the second quarter due to surrendering a flurry of goals \u2014 although she would return later \u2014 was just one of the markers of a disappointing display by Virginia. Furthermore, the Cavaliers were beaten on the draws by a 22-3 margin. Whenever the Orange would score, they\u2019d get possession right back, making a comeback near impossible for Virginia. Just under five minutes into the contest, another member of the Irish \u201cbig three\u201d enjoyed a big moment, as graduate attacker Madison Ahern opened the scoring with her 52nd goal of the season. But Notre Dame\u2019s terrific trio went abnormally quiet for the remaining 55 minutes. Boston College limited Choma, Ahern and graduate attacker Jackie Wolak \u2014 who regularly combine for double-digit points \u2014 to six total points. Almost all of the Irish goals happened through individual efforts, as Wolak posted the only Notre Dame assist against stiff defense. Despite those struggles, Notre Dame mostly matched the Eagles with strong defense. At the first quarter\u2019s end, Boston College led 3-2 on goals from Rachel Clark, Kayla Martello and Belle Smith. Choma fired back late in the quarter, pulling the Irish within a goal. To overcome their recent postseason failures, the Orange had to get through the team they haven\u2019t beaten under Treanor: Boston College.

As the Orange looked to win their first ACC Tournament since Treanor netted a game-winner as a player versus North Carolina in 2015, it\u2019s only fitting that the Eagles handed them the loss. Yunger had a leadoff double to start the inning and then Burress blasted a two-run home run to extend the lead to 4-1. The home run party was just beginning for Georgia Tech though. Ellis hit a solo shot to make it 5-1 and after Jones grounded out, Giesler hit a solo home run to make it 6-1. Miami made a pitching change, but it did not make an immediate difference. Green was hit by a pitch, Zmarzlak singled to put runners on the corners, and then Becchetti had a out RBI single to make it 7-1. That was the last run of the inning, but it was huge for Georgia Tech to extend the lead to six runs.

Their victory was backed by stupendous performances from skipper Muhammad Waseem as well as young batter Alishan Sharafu before pacer Junaid Siddique, in the company of Aayan Afzal Khan, led the bowling attack to help UAE win the final comfortably, as per the release by ILT20. Muhammad Waseem scored a blistering 56-ball-century and was well supported by his opening partner Alishan Sharafu who contributed 34 to their opening stand of 94 runs. By Syracuse University Athletics Syracuse, N. Y. \u2014 Boston College scored the last five goals to repeat as ACC tournament champions, defeating Syracuse, 15-8, on Sunday afternoon in Charlotte, North Carolina. The loss was Syracuse\u2019s second in 10 days to Boston College and sixth straight overall to the Eagles dating back to the 2021 national championship game. Of the six losses, Sunday\u2019s was the largest margin of defeat. Syracuse will learn its NCAA tournament seeding and draw on May 5. The selection show is scheduled for 9 p. m. , on ESPNU. The Eagles (16-3) received a six-goal effort from Kayla Martello. Syracuse (14-5) was led by Emma Ward , who finished with two goals and one assist. After the teams entered halftime tied at 7-7, Boston College controlled the second half, accumulating eight of nine goals over the final two quarters. Martello finally broke through with 4 minutes and 25 seconds remaining until halftime with her 52nd goal of the year. But senior attacker Mary Kelly Doherty, the hero of the March 16 game, answered just moments later to make the halftime score 4-3. Coming out of the break, Wolak tied the game with her 53rd goal of the season. However, less than two minutes later, Andrea Reynolds and Boston College broke the deadlock for good. Emma LoPinto scored three goals in eight minutes between the end of the third quarter and the early part of the fourth, orchestrating a major surge from the Eagles. With 10 minutes remaining in regulation, Boston College had opened up a 9-5 lead. Notre Dame wouldn\u2019t let its first postseason run die easily, though.

Just under five minutes into the contest, another member of the Irish \u201cbig three\u201d enjoyed a big moment, as graduate attacker Madison Ahern opened the scoring with her 52nd goal of the season. But Notre Dame\u2019s terrific trio went abnormally quiet for the remaining 55 minutes. Boston College limited Choma, Ahern and graduate attacker Jackie Wolak \u2014 who regularly combine for double-digit points \u2014 to six total points. Almost all of the Irish goals happened through individual efforts, as Wolak posted the only Notre Dame assist against stiff defense. Despite those struggles, Notre Dame mostly matched the Eagles with strong defense. At the first quarter\u2019s end, Boston College led 3-2 on goals from Rachel Clark, Kayla Martello and Belle Smith. Choma fired back late in the quarter, pulling the Irish within a goal. By Syracuse University Athletics Syracuse, N. Y. \u2014 Boston College scored the last five goals to repeat as ACC tournament champions, defeating Syracuse, 15-8, on Sunday afternoon in Charlotte, North Carolina. The loss was Syracuse\u2019s second in 10 days to Boston College and sixth straight overall to the Eagles dating back to the 2021 national championship game. Of the six losses, Sunday\u2019s was the largest margin of defeat. Syracuse will learn its NCAA tournament seeding and draw on May 5. The selection show is scheduled for 9 p. m. , on ESPNU. The Eagles (16-3) received a six-goal effort from Kayla Martello. Syracuse (14-5) was led by Emma Ward , who finished with two goals and one assist. After the teams entered halftime tied at 7-7, Boston College controlled the second half, accumulating eight of nine goals over the final two quarters. The Irish pressed on with their rally from there, but Eagles goalkeeper Shea Dolce made three saves to send Boston College to the championship game. In that championship game, the Eagles would defeat Syracuse by a 15-8 score on Sunday. Notre Dame now looks ahead to the NCAA Tournament, which begins Friday, May 10. The Irish will learn their first opponent and destination during the selection show at 9 p. m. Sunday, May 5. 1 seed Syracuse (14-5, 8-1 ACC) falling to No. 3 seed Boston College (16-3, 7-2 ACC) 15-8 in the conference title game. Boston College scored 10 of the final 11 goals in the contest, handing the Orange their worst loss in 2024 and sixth straight at the hands of the Eagles. For the first time all season, SU didn\u2019t score in a regulation quarter. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good defense,\u201d SU head coach Kayla Treanor said postgame. \u201cThey pressure you but we just really didn\u2019t do any of the things that we had talked about. We were just unrecognizable. \u201d Syracuse\u2019s offensive started with a bang as Natalie Smith opened the scoring 13 seconds in with a bullet past Dolce. The rest of the offense followed suit as Olivia Adamson notched two, with Savannah Sweitzer and Emma Ward each adding a goal. Three minutes later, Adamson scored her second goal as SU led 4-1 \u2014 a pivotal swing. A minute later, Syracuse led 5-1 after Emma Ward fired a free-position shot past Dolce. Everything was going the Orange\u2019s way. Then, history repeated itself. Boston College stole all of SU\u2019s momentum to close the first quarter, scoring two unanswered goals to cut its deficit to 5-3. At the start of the second quarter, the Eagles tormented SU in transition to make it 5-4. Despite another Kate Mashewske draw control win, one of nine straight, the Orange didn\u2019t score and traded possessions with Boston College over the next five minutes. But one of Sydney Scales\u2019 game-high five ground ball pickups set up a Kayla Martello goal as BC scored its fourth straight to tie the game 5-5. Dubai [UAE], April 28 (ANI): The UAE cricket team qualified for the 2025 Asia Cup, a tournament they will be participating in after nine long years, following a 55-run win over Oman in the ACC Men's Premier Cup final on Sunday. Their victory was backed by stupendous performances from skipper Muhammad Waseem as well as young batter Alishan Sharafu before pacer Junaid Siddique, in the company of Aayan Afzal Khan, led the bowling attack to help UAE win the final comfortably, as per the release by ILT20. Muhammad Waseem scored a blistering 56-ball-century and was well supported by his opening partner Alishan Sharafu who contributed 34 to their opening stand of 94 runs. \u201d Cassidy Weeks then put the game away for the Eagles, winning the draw control and rolling around through the middle before firing the ball past Sweitzer. LoPinto and Molly Driscoll added two more goals for the Eagles while their defense continued to lock down the Orange, en route to a 15\u20138 win and a second straight ACC championship. \u201cI think one of the gifts of the team is that they play for each other,\u201d Walker-Weinstein said. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing individually or for individual goals, they\u2019re playing for each other. \u201d Now, the Eagles look ahead to the NCAA Tournament selection show and shift focus toward lifting a second trophy this year. \u201cOnce we get back to practice next week, we\u2019re kind of closing this chapter,\u201d Scales said. \u201cWe\u2019re onto the next, taking it each game at a time, and not taking anything for granted. Martello finally broke through with 4 minutes and 25 seconds remaining until halftime with her 52nd goal of the year. But senior attacker Mary Kelly Doherty, the hero of the March 16 game, answered just moments later to make the halftime score 4-3. Coming out of the break, Wolak tied the game with her 53rd goal of the season. However, less than two minutes later, Andrea Reynolds and Boston College broke the deadlock for good. Emma LoPinto scored three goals in eight minutes between the end of the third quarter and the early part of the fourth, orchestrating a major surge from the Eagles.

Syracuse (14-4, 8-1 ACC) completely dominated the No. 5 Virginia Cavaliers in Friday\u2019s semifinal, winning 19-4 after amassing an insurmountable 13-1 halftime lead. Four different Orange players had a hat trick in the win, including Olivia Adamson, with a team-best four goals, Emma Tyrell, Emma Ward and Natalie Smith. Overall, nine different players scored at least one goal for the Orange. BC became the first team seeded third or lower to win the ACC title since 2015. This team is far from a plucky underdog, though. The Eagles have beaten the Orange six straight times and made the NCAA championship game six straight seasons.

The Notre Dame women\u2019s lacrosse team can only hope someone else will defeat Boston College in this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament. After a 9-7 loss to the Eagles in Friday\u2019s ACC semifinals, the Irish have now seen four tournament runs end at the hands of Boston College in the last four seasons. Last year, the Eagles eliminated Notre Dame in both the ACC and NCAA Championships. This year\u2019s game represented a rematch of Notre Dame\u2019s epic win at Chestnut Hill on March 16. The Irish scored late to beat the Eagles 15-14, winning at Chestnut Hill for the first time in two decades. That nail-biter marked the second victory of a 10-game win streak that carried Notre Dame into Friday\u2019s matchup.

College Sports Boston College lacrosse rallies past Syracuse to capture second straight ACC tournament title Next up for the Eagles is the NCAA tournament. Boston College seized command and never looked back Sunday. Chris Remick/BC Athletics Boston College lacrosse erased an early four-goal deficit and outlasted Syracuse, 15-8, to cement its second consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship Sunday in Charlotte. Kayla Martello took six shots and delivered each time. Mckenna Davis added two goals and three assists, becoming the program\u2019s all-time assist leader with 132. Emma LoPinto contributed three goals and two assists, and Shea Dolce made 10 saves for the No. 3 Eagles (16-3). \u201cGoing back to back is an amazing feeling,\u201d Martello said. \u201cWe\u2019re just so proud. \u201d The No. 1 Orange (14-5) built a commanding 5-1 lead, but the Eagles regrouped and got their defense organized. \u201cWe two had transition goals that were great,\u201d Martello said. \u201cBut then [Walker-Weinstein] brought us in and said like those goals are great, you got the momentum, and now we\u2019re looking for layups. \u201d BC\u2019s defense settled down after the early push from Syracuse with stronger marking, active sticks, and getting back to their strengths, according to Sydney Scales. \u201cFocusing on just getting back to those basics which were one v. ones and communication, and once we did that everything else fell into place,\u201d Scales said.

But the Orange restored its one-goal lead when Emma Tyrrell shoveled a shot past Dolce even while surrounded by BC defenders. The Orange added another just 36 seconds later to give Syracuse a 7\u20135 lead. Senior attacker Morgan Schwab got the Cavaliers on the board early in the second quarter when freshman attacker Madison Alaimo feinted a dodge and picked out Schwab on the crease for a finish in the top left corner. However, this would be the last time that Virginia added to the scoreboard during the first half. Tyrell completed a first-half hat trick, and freshman midfielder Joely Caramelli, senior attacker Emma Ward and senior midfielder Maddy Baxter all added to their totals for the Orange. A 13-1 halftime deficit was indicative of the Cavaliers\u2019 first half struggles, and Syracuse had begun to run away with the victory. The Orange scored again just 16 seconds into the third quarter thanks to senior midfielder Natalie Smith. Three minutes later, Adamson scored her second goal as SU led 4-1 \u2014 a pivotal swing.

Electrek\u2019s Take Firstly \u2013 it makes absolutely no sense to lay off the Supercharger team. Supercharging is an incredible opportunity for Tesla, especially now that everyone else has adopted NACS. Tesla has a fairly simple business case from here on out to become the leading \u201cgas station of the future. \u201d With its experience and lead on Superchargers, its more reliable and better-designed stations, and its existing business footprint with so many stations installed around the globe, the company has a natural lead. Tesla deployed a record number of Superchargers last quarter and now operates 57,579 Superchargers at 6,249 locations around the world. Electrek\u2019s Take I\u2019m really perplexed by Tesla firing its charging team. If one thing was a clear success at Tesla, it\u2019s the Supercharger network. Tesla had just won the charging standard battle \u2013 making NACS the new standard in North America and all other automakers adopting and jumping onboard with the Supercharger network. Now more than ever, Tesla needs to grow the network to support the onboarding of non-Tesla EVs and its own growing fleet. And yet, Tesla fired the team instead and slowed down Supercharger installations \u2013 if not stopped entirely. This is a bearish move if I have ever seen one. To lay off that whole team just when the company has earned such a big win, when billions in public money is available for buildout (which would not have been available without industry NACS adoption, which was, again, spearheaded by Tinucci\u2019s negotiations), and when there is a lead to be maintained, is absolutely crazy. This move, alone, would erode any confidence I had left in Tesla\u2019s CEO \u2013 if I still had any. On layoffs in general, we noted in our coverage of Tesla\u2019s layoffs that the worst part about situations like this is that they greatly affect morale. We imagine morale can\u2019t be great within Tesla right now after huge layoffs, but there can at least be a sense of relief that they\u2019re over after a large round of layoffs closes..\n\nQuestion: What makes no sense according to Electrek in this Electric vehicle manufacturer's recent layoffs?\nAnswers:\nA.

For generations, her family has made special jewelry from scratch in Oaxaca. \"Ruby she is from Antiguas Maravillas, a jewelry workshop that has been going on for three generations now,\" said Sanchez. \"She's bringing all the jewelry that her family makes in their house. \" Some pieces take her one day to make while other special pieces that may be used for performances can take up to three weeks. \"It is very valuable to have her here and other vendors from Oaxaca here,\" added Sanchez. It was all part of a collective effort to bring the community together through arts and culture. Though many Coloradans may call Oaxaca home, the Mexican city is 2,000 miles away from Denver. On Saturday, an event was held in the Westwood neighborhood to honor and celebrate Oaxacan culture. Inside Re:Vision's Art and Cultural Center a taste of Oaxaca is unfolding. Mariana Del Hierro, executive director for Re:Vision, says this is part of their cultural event series. Re:Vision is a nonprofit that aims to work with communities impacted by social inequities. \"With these cultural celebrations, we not only highlight the beauty of Mexican culture, but it also creates a space for our vendors to really create that local economy and have successful businesses with us,\" said Del Hierro. At the event, small vendors have a big platform to connect with Oaxacan heritage and proudly share it with visitors. These particular specimens are among the most unique, those of Tiffany\u2019s Blue Book, as the company calls its annual catalogue, the first to be delivered directly to customers\u2019 homes in 1845 and famed for its impressive, custom-made jewelry. Audrey Hepburn, Gloria Vanderbilt and Kate Winslet have bought its offerings in that past. At the festive Thursday night dinner in question, Emily Blunt, Olivia Wilde, Usher, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Gal Gadot displayed pieces on their necks, hands and lapels in celebration of the launch of what the brand considers its most precious annual treasure. In just two hours, Sanchez says they sold out. She brought the idea of bringing back the event because of its success. \"The first event that we did, we realized there were a lot of people that were really excited and really happy to be participating and to be supporting the crafts and food that we showcased from Oaxaca,\" she said. A big draw for event-goers is traditional Oaxaca clothing and food, including tlayudas; a traditional Oaxacan dish that consists of a large thin crunchy tortilla, beans, cheese, lettuce and protein of choice. \"We really celebrate food sovereignty and cultural preservation and what happens getting at the root of Mexican culinary and traditional practices,\" said Del Hierro.

David Corenswet has been cast as the new Superman, with production already underway. The ensemble cast also features Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, and Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda as The Engineer, among others. James Gunn\u2019s upcoming Superman: Legacy is currently slated for a 2025 release. Rupert has also been a rumoured potential replacement Meanwhile, Pete Davison, who recently starred in the comedy-drama\u2019s spin-off Beyond Paradise, volunteered to take on the role, telling HELLO!: \u201cI'd certainly consider it. but I suspect he'll be a lot younger than me.

'\u201d DC fans took Fillion\u2019s words as Gunn already working on the reboot of the DCEU since the release of The Suicide Squad in 2021, more than a year before he and Peter Safran were named co-CEOs of DC Studios in October 2022. However, Gunn clarified on Threads that Fillion misspoke, which meant he found out about his Green Lantern casting during the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 premiere party. Gunn went on to clarify the rumor that he always intended to replace Cavill as Superman since he helmed The Suicide Squad. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand how that fits,\u201d he shared on Threads. 3\" \u2013 well after Gunn and Safran were appointed as heads of DC Studios. Gunn underscores the absurdity of the theory, questioning why he would bother lying about such a thing when the outcome would have been the same. He emphasises that his Superman project was always pitched as a fresh start, not a continuation of Cavill's storyline. Cavill's fleeting Superman comeback turned into a PR mess last fall. His \"Black Adam\" cameo and social media announcement seemed to assure his return, only for Gunn and Safran's DC Universe revamp to dash those hopes. Cavill's abrupt departure, especially after leaving \"The Witcher\" series, made the situation even more controversial. David Corenswet will now take on the iconic role in Gunn's upcoming \"Superman\" movie, slated for release on July 11, 2025. However, when Gunn and Safran took over DC and planned to reboot the universe, they announced they would be recasting Superman.

Back in 2022, the Black Adam end-credits scene featured the return of Henry Cavill\u2019s Superman, and it was announced soon after that this version of the Man of Steel would appear in more then-upcoming DC movies.

K. Rowling's continued anti-transgender comments, as well as her support for others with transphobic views. The actor, who earned a Tony Award nomination on April 30, said in a new interview with The Atlantic that he hasn't spoken to Rowling, 58, in years. Radcliffe starred as the titular hero in all eight Potter films, based on her bestselling novels, from 2001 to 2011. \"It makes me really sad, ultimately, because I do look at the person that I met, the times that we met, and the books that she wrote and the world that she created, and all of that is to me so deeply empathic,\" Radcliffe said of Rowling and her controversial comments about gender.

A lot of people found some solace in those books and films who were dealing with feeling closeted or rejected by their family or living with a secret. \u201d Then, in June 2020, J.

Nathan Congleton/NBC via Getty Reps for Rowling did not immediately respond to EW\u2019s request for comment. \u201d Radcliffe was someone he could discuss this with: \u201cLogical, emotionally intelligent enough, and also had enough of a sense of \u2018I get it, Dave. \u2019 \u201d Radcliffe at the Hudson Theatre, in New York (Lila Barth for The Atlantic) \u201cMe and Dave go to very heavy places,\u201d Radcliffe says. \u201cAlso, and there\u2019s no way of reading this and not some people getting the wrong impression, but also there\u2019s a huge amount of humor in those conversations where he\u2019s devising essentially some kind of Rube Goldberg machine so that he can still be the person who does it. \u201d Radcliffe offers another example. \u201cI remember one of the funniest voice messages I ever received was from him on safari in Africa, talking about what a brilliant time he was having. And also, how wonderful would it be to die at the horn of a rhinoceros. \" J. K. Rowling on March 29, 2022. Stuart C.

Pitt filed a motion in response to this argument to turn over all her past NDAs to his lawyers.

ANGELINA JOLIE\u2019S PAST NDAS The Maleficent star maintains that Pitt\u2019s demand for her past NDAs with third parties is unjustifiable. However, Jolie has made her stand clear that it was the clause in his NDA, which supposedly covered his alleged spousal and child abuse, that posed a problem. Angelina Jolie Calls Brad Pitt\u2019s New NDA Request To Be Abusive In Nature Angelina Jolie\u2019s lawyers argue that Pitt\u2019s demand to review every contract signed by Jolie would reveal private info of third parties, thus violating their rights. The court documents filed by the actress argued (via Page Six): \u201cThese third parties have their own privacy rights, and Pitt is not giving them any notice whatsoever to allow them to protect their rights. \u201d Jolie\u2019s documents also claim that the demands from the actor are unreasonable, forcing Jolie to spend time and money on going through her old contracts.

Going through a grunge phase, I put Nirvana\u2019s Nevermind album on shuffle. As Smells Like Teen Spirit reached its crescendo, I began to feel uncomfortable. It was all just too intense and I couldn\u2019t relax. Kurt Cobain may have been a musical genius but there\u2019s a time and place for all music, and for me, this was not in the bedroom. I asked my boyfriend to turn it off and we continued having sex in silence but the atmosphere had changed, and I didn\u2019t enjoy myself as much as I probably could have. Returning to my present day experience, I\u2019m glad to say that there were some highlights. This was an evening filled with nostalgia and incredible stories of interactions with rock stars, including how John is often credited as being the first person to interview Kurt Cobain from Nirvana calling him at his mum's house in Washington before Smells Like Teen Spirit had become the anthem of the 90s decade. If you want to delve into the alternative music scene, John Robb could guide you with his encyclopaedic knowledge and his sharp ability to link music to culture and politics.

I needed to grapple with the good, the bad, and the ugly of living in the Northwest, and just being a feminist in a band. Editor\u2019s picks What was the process like for you? I\u2019m a first-time writer, so I just did the butt-in-chair method. I just got my butt in the chair and just wrote, and I was very lucky I didn\u2019t have the blank page problem. I would just sit there and write. And some days the stuff I wrote was terrible, and some days it ended up being something I could use. But I just sat there, on the days that I had planned to work, I would just sit there and write and write and write and write. It was 600 pages, so I had to cut it down. DHAKA: It is jubilation time for Bangladesh , as a silent feature film made in Dhaka about a gay man won the Special Jury award at the recently concluded Moscow International Film Festival (MIFF). In an industry where films on LGBTQI+ issues are few in number, this international acclaim is a watershed moment not just for the nation's independent cinema but also for the community. In 2012, Noman Robin's 'Common Gender' explored the love story of a transgender, while highlighting public perception towards the trans community. Four years later, on April 25, 2016, Xulhaz Mannan, the founder of Bangladesh's first LGBT magazine, was hacked to death. Just a day after his eight death anniversary, director Asif Islam received the Special Jury award for ' Nirvana ' on April 26, 2024 at MIFF. It was OK, I guess. I had an orgasm but, given the choice again, I\u2019d opt for something less \u2018in your face\u2019. Above all, this experiment has proven to me just how important it is to be selective when you\u2019re trying to set the scene. The same principle goes for other sexual aids like lighting, porn and sex toys. That being said, if you\u2019re sleeping with someone you know well, have fun with it. Line up playlists for each other as a sexy game or choose one at random and let Spotify decide your fate. Just perhaps ask the other person if there is something they absolutely do not want to hear first (if someone put on Take Care by Drake, for example, I\u2019d be straight out of there as I have unpleasant memories attached to that song). Even if you\u2019ve followed everything from her early 1990s releases on the Pacific Northwest indie label Kill Rock Stars to her recent string of sold-out reunion shows, there\u2019s stunning new wisdom to be gleaned from the memoir. She starts with her childhood in Maryland, goes through her time at Evergreen State in Olympia, Washington and the formation of the feminist-forward punk scene there, and into her marriage to Beastie Boys\u2019 Adam Horovitz, their adoption journey, and her fight against Lyme. Yet reading it, one gets the sense she\u2019s grappling with each memory as it comes to her, working through why she made the decisions she did, the ways she could have reacted differently, while accepting and owning up to the choices she made. It turns out that\u2019s exactly what she was doing. It was a game-changing moment that would shape the entirety of Grohl\u2019s career with Nirvana and on to the Foo Fighters. Some of the classic foundational acts well known to the stories of Nirvana and Foo Fighters are here: Pixies, Melvins, and Bad Brains \u2014 all punk-forward groups that would help provide cultural touchstones for a generation of rock acts. But Grohl also finds some remarkable expanses in his taste by naming perhaps the least acclaimed Led Zeppelin album and giving a shout-out to legendary rap pioneers Public Enemy. Dave Grohl is a man with legendarily eclectic tastes. The Foo Fighters leader and former Nirvana drummer might have punk rock in his blood, but that genre of music only came to him in his teenage years. I only lived there until I was 13. And it actually made me feel a little better, because I was like, \u201cOh, well, no wonder it got so bad, it was never treated. We didn\u2019t even know about Lyme disease then. \u201d But I did get the right treatment, and I\u2019m doing really, really well. That\u2019s great. I can tour, it\u2019s bananas. Who thought that was going to happen? You write in the book about your friendship with Kurt Cobain, and how hard to lose him, but also to see it become a national story. How has it been for you to see Nirvana continue to be such a cultural force, even 30 years later? You cannot walk three feet in any country, any city, without seeing a Nirvana shirt. That\u2019s pretty amazing for two guys from Aberdeen to do that. Someone said their first memory was also aged five: Obama becoming US President. What? That\u2019s your first memory? How\u2019s this possible? I know, I know \u2026 time\u2019s arrow and all that, but c\u2019mon on, it\u2019s getting ridiculous. The thing is, though, I\u2019m not one of these grizzly old greybeards who thinks that because I\u2019ve been around the block a few millions times, I know everything and \u2018the kids\u2019 know naff all. Quite the reverse. See this world we\u2019re living in? Us daft oldies made it: this is the product of slacker GenX and our insane Baby-boomer parents. Pity GenX, we were too busy being cool to fix the world. As poor Kurt sang in Smells Like Teen Spirit - a true anthem of a generation: \u2018Here we are now, entertain us. \u2019 That\u2019s all we wanted: a good time. If Mr Scarlett Johansson's comedy turned stale, his wife was as fresh as they come. It pains me to write this, but our painfully mediocre Veep actually shone up on the dais in a sequin show-stopper gown. Special mention must also go to Fran Drescher, who bossed it up in a teasy, low-cut bridal-white pantsuit. Timeless and tasty in Armani Priv\u00e9, you could hardly blame her milquetoast husband for constantly reminding the audience that he married her. (We can't quite believe it either, Colin!)

That\u2019s pretty amazing for two guys from Aberdeen to do that. I think the whole mythology and the conspiracy theories are creepy and weird, but I don\u2019t really pay that much attention. I just see kids all over the world wearing Nirvana shirts, I see 80-year-old women wearing Nirvana shirts, and it makes me smile. I am like, that\u2019s kind of cool, a band that was practicing in the garage a few blocks from where I lived, they\u2019re just still everywhere, and people love their music. And I feel proud of them. It must be very exciting to see art that meant something to you continue to be meaningful to generations of people. I just really wish that Kurt could have enjoyed it. And that\u2019s the hard part, just being like, \u201cWow, I wish that he would\u2019ve seen us live past the stupid Nineties, you\u2019re-a-sellout thing. It was OK, I guess. I had an orgasm but, given the choice again, I\u2019d opt for something less \u2018in your face\u2019. Above all, this experiment has proven to me just how important it is to be selective when you\u2019re trying to set the scene. The same principle goes for other sexual aids like lighting, porn and sex toys. That being said, if you\u2019re sleeping with someone you know well, have fun with it. Line up playlists for each other as a sexy game or choose one at random and let Spotify decide your fate. Just perhaps ask the other person if there is something they absolutely do not want to hear first (if someone put on Take Care by Drake, for example, I\u2019d be straight out of there as I have unpleasant memories attached to that song). The first time most of America got to see that was when they appeared on SNL in early 1992 just as \u201cJeremy\u201d was breaking as the Seattle band\u2019s first major hit. It\u2019s raw and commanding, and simply put, incredible. (Image credit: YouTube) David Byrne (2020) David Byrne has been known for his theatrical performances all the way back to his early years in Talking Heads and his 2000 performance on SNL could be his peak. It features the musicians that would make his Broadway show, American Utopia, a hit and it\u2019s an amazing performance. (Image credit: NBC) Billy Preston (1975) The late Billy Preston has two tidbits of music history that only he will ever be associated with. First, he\u2019s the only guest musician to play on both a Rolling Stones album and a Beatles album. Second, he was the first musical guest to ever play on SNL, performing \u201cNothing from Nothing\u201d on the show's debut episode in 1975. (Image credit: NBC) Mariah Carey (1990) The first time America was exposed to Mariah Carey was in the summer of 1990 when she performed \u201cAmerica The Beautiful\u201d at the NBA Finals. The first time we all saw her perform one of her own songs was on SNL later that fall. The rest, as they say, is history. It\u2019s funny to imagine those four cute little Beatles years later on LSD. Where did they go wrong, writing something like \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019 and influencing Charles Manson? I\u2019d call this timeless. \u201d 2. The B-52\u2019s \u2013 The B-52\u2019s The elastic queer new wave sensibilities of The B-52\u2019s might not seem to have a direct connection to the walloping drums and buzzsaw guitars that Grohl favours in his own music, but it was the spirit of the album that spoke most to Grohl. The idea of being different and being able to make music that wasn\u2019t just pop or rock was a revelation to a young Grohl. \u201cI remember seeing the B-52\u2019s on Saturday Night Live, and this introduced me to the world of weird music,\u201d Grohl said about the life-changing moment. \u201cI was young, my parents were asleep. Your first 20 songs are going to suck, but that\u2019s part of the process. You have to make your first shitty songs so that you can make your first good song, that you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, this is it. This is my first good song. \u201d..\n\nQuestion: Which band was Kurt Cobain most commonly associated with in relation to this band?\nAnswers:\nA. Melvins\nB. Dio\nC. Pixies\nD. Black Sabbath\nE.

Among the items that fell away Tuesday were a ban on bishops ordaining LGBTQ candidates for ministry, and a series of mandatory minimum penalties for clergy who officiate same-sex weddings. Both items were adopted by the General Conference in 2019 under the so-called Traditional Plan that solidified restrictive policies on homosexuality. Another ban, on funding for LGBTQ affinity groups or ministries, is much older. It too was eliminated. Delegates passed the three items, part of a much larger package of petitions, 667-54 with no debate.

Which is why the internet has gone wild for a video showing Brinkley dancing to the song at the piano man\u2019s recent concert. The Tik Tok video shows the former model, now 70, grooving to the song with a huge smile on her face as Joel, 74, performs. Brinkley starred in the music video for the song two years before she and Joel married in 1985, the same year they welcomed their daughter Alexa Ray Joel. Brinkley and Joel divorced in 1994. \" The hit song was released in 1983, with the original source of inspiration of the song being debated at times. When Joel first wrote the song, he was dating model Elle MacPherson and titled the song \"Uptown Girls\" after all models in Manhattan. Joel said on \"The Howard Stern Show\" in 2010 that when he began dating Brinkley, he made the song singular. \"I contacted Christie later on down the road after Elle and I had stopped dating,\" Joel told Stern. \"Then I started dating Christie, and rather than it being about all these different girls, she became the uptown girl. I started writing it about one person. \" Brinkley starred in the \"Uptown Girl\" music video alongside Joel. The two married in 1985 and divorced in 1994. Their daughter, 38-year-old Alexa Ray Joel, was also in attendance at the concert. Macpherson said she believed the song was about \u201call the uptown girls\u201d given the singer\u2019s penchant for \u201ctall girls. \u201d Joel appeared to confirm that in 2014\u2019s \u201cBilly Joel: The Definitive Biography,\u201d where he shared that the original title had been a plural \u201cUptown Girls,\u201d but he made it singular after falling for Brinkley. ***Exclusive*** (Photo by Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic) Joel and Brinkley share one child together.

The UFL\u2019s weekend schedule begins with a doubleheader at 5:00 p. m. MT on April 27. The first game will feature the San Antonio Brahams taking on the Arlington Renegades. A second game featuring the Birmingham Stallions against the Houston Roughnecks will begin at the same time. The two contests will be regionally televised on Fox and available to stream on fuboTV (try it free). The action will continue with a doubleheader on Sunday, April 28. First, the St. Louis Battlehawks will take on the D. C. Defenders at 10:00 a. m. MT on ESPN (available to stream on fuboTV \u2014 try it free). After that, the Michigan Panthers will face the Memphis Showboats at 1:00 p. m. MT on Fox/fuboTV. San Antonio has leaned upon a decent offense while also relying upon a rock-solid defense to get off to a 3-1 start. Arlington tightened up on defense last week, but that was in part due to the fact Houston is so awful. The Renegades allowed 27 or more points in each of the first 3 games, so San Antonio should be able to move the ball well against Arlington. If you prefer, the BRAHMAS -2. 5 (-105) are also a solid play on the road. It would be silly to bet each thing together. Laying the points is much cheaper, and all San Antonio has to do is win by 3 points. You might prefer the moneyline, though, as San Antonio won its only previous road game by a single point in Week 2 at Memphis. However, the team has floundered over the last few weeks, losing three straight games. To make matters worse, Memphis has failed to reach the 20-point mark at all this season. Michigan is second in the USFL Conference, two games behind the undefeated Birmingham Stallions. The Showboats are tied with the Roughnecks for third, one game behind the Panthers. These two teams met in Week 4 of the 2023 USFL season, with the Showboats beating the Panthers in Detroit, 29-10.

Three plays later, Quinten Dormady found tight end Alize Mack wide open down the seam for a 24-yard touchdown. The extra point conversion was no good, making the score 9-0.

Durant, a two-time NBA Finals MVP and 14-time NBA All-Star, took the loss in stride. He was simply outshined by Edwards, who became the only player other than Kobe Bryant to ever record at least 40 points to finish a sweep on the road before turning 23 years old. There simply wasn\u2019t an answer for Edwards on either end of the floor and it didn\u2019t take much for Durant to acknowledge that.

If their postgame media session was any indication, their relationship seems to be a healthy one, one where Edwards can be open and honest with Towns for the betterment of himself and the team. Before the season, Edwards said Towns could be the MVP of the team, and he has always doled out praise for Towns whenever he can, even when telling him what he was doing wrong as well. \"He's a mismatch problem, every team that we play,\" Edwards said. \"Pretty much that week of [practice] we was just figuring out how to get KAT involved in the game. We did a great job of that throughout the series. \". PHOENIX \u2013 Even in the back hallways of Footprint Center, the chanting came through loud and clear. \"M-V-P. M-V-P. \" Amid that backing chorus from visiting Timberwolves fans, Anthony Edwards made his way from the floor, where he received congratulations from his childhood hero Kevin Durant, to the Wolves locker room after the team won its first playoff series since 2004 with a 122-116 Game 4 victory over the Suns on Sunday night. Edwards slapped several people high fives and then met Karl-Anthony Towns, who walked with him into the locker room. Later, they sat side-by-side for their postgame media obligations: Edwards the young budding superstar who took down his hero for his playoff series victory, and Towns, who finally saw his years of loyalty to the organization pay off. \"I couldn't be happier,\" Towns said. Added assistant Micah Nori: \"One thing about Ant, he's become more of a vocal leader. But he's also one of those guys that he puts in the work, so guys see him working. He's got some self humor \u2014 you've seen all of his interviews \u2014 he's the first one to congratulate and move all of his glory or whatever over to his teammates. \" The Wolves are in the position they are because of Edwards' budding leadership and also because of the relationship between him and Towns. Towns came into the franchise in 2015 as the next superstar, and over the past few seasons, he has made room for Edwards to take the spotlight. That was certainly the case in this series, whether by choice or by foul trouble for Towns. 0 points, 8. 0 rebounds, 6. 3 assists, and 2. 0 steals per game. He also shot 43. 8 percent on 3-pointers against the Suns while recording some jaw-dropping highlights. Durant saw all of this and during his postgame press conference, the praise for Edwards only continued. \"So impressed with Ant.

My favorite player to watch. Just grown so much since he came into the league. At 22, his love for the game just shines bright and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I like him the most. He loves basketball. He adapted, and you could see him during postgame interviews all series trading jokes and congratulations with Edwards and Gobert. Gobert became a target for analysts who believed this trade didn't work, and he never complained about that perception. Edwards slowly developed a strong relationship with Finch, and he spent many of his interviews praising or deferring to older teammates. Naz Reid and Mike Conley re-signed with the Wolves knowing they could have made more as free agents. They believed in the people around them here. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Reid, Jaden McDaniels and Edwards are examples of young players growing before our eyes, a testament to the Wolves' player development team. Those are just some of the reasons this Timberwolves team is such a joy to watch. Spectacular talent. Shrewd management. Passionate and expert coaching. Playing with my man on my right, it makes it more special, to be able to do it with someone I got so much admiration for, so much respect for. \"   Before they went to the locker room, the rest of the team had piled in after visiting coach Chris Finch in a nearby medical room. Finch celebrated his first series victory as head coach while nursing what the team said was a torn right patellar tendon rupture he suffered after point guard Mike Conley collided with him late in the fourth quarter. \"He didn't want to see me at first,\" Conley said. \"I walked in and he started to run away.

But [I] was really impressed with him and he\u2019s going to be somebody that I\u2019m going to be following for the rest of his career. After the Suns were swept by the Timberwolves in the first round of the postseason, Kevin Durant had a classy message for Anthony Edwards. Durant, a two-time NBA Finals MVP and 14-time NBA All-Star, took the loss in stride. He was simply outshined by Edwards, who became the only player other than Kobe Bryant to ever record at least 40 points to finish a sweep on the road before turning 23 years old. There simply wasn\u2019t an answer for Edwards on either end of the floor and it didn\u2019t take much for Durant to acknowledge that. Fortunately, he was able to share a very special moment with Edwards on the court after his elimination: Kevin Durant congratulates Anthony Edwards after the end of the Timberwolves-Suns series \ud83e\udd1d The two will be teammates for Team USA during the Olympics in Paris this summer. pic. twitter. 0 points, 8. 0 rebounds, 6. 3 assists, and 2. 0 steals per game. He also shot 43. 8 percent on 3-pointers against the Suns while recording some jaw-dropping highlights.

My favorite player to watch. Just grown so much since he came into the league. At 22, his love for the game just shines bright and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I like him the most. He loves basketball. The Minnesota Timberwolves completed their sweep of the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night. Thanks to an absolutely monster second half in Game 4 from Anthony Edwards, Minnesota picked up a 122-116 win that gave them only the third series victor in franchise history. Edwards wasn\u2019t just great in Game 4, as he was nothing short of spectacular throughout the series. He consistently took it to anyone and everyone on Phoenix, which included a memorable clip from Game 1 where Edwards started jawing at Kevin Durant. All KD could do was smile, nod, and talk back, which in its own way served as recognition that Edwards has firmly arrived as one of the faces of the NBA and very best players on the planet. Durant has long been one of the league\u2019s absolute best when it comes to lifting up the next generation, but even by that standard, it\u2019s clear that he sees something really special in Edwards, who has said plenty of times in the past that Durant is his favorite player. Fortunately for the pair, they\u2019re slated to be teammates on Team USA during the Olympics this summer, although Edwards has made clear he\u2019s going to talk some junk to KD once they get there. He\u2019s played against great competition and did his thing. I don\u2019t think you can take that away from him. He\u2019ll be the most athletic, powerful, and the best player to ever play the game. Zach Collins: I never got to watch Jordan live. I only saw highlights. Maybe I\u2019m a little biased. LeBron\u2019s been my favorite player since I\u2019ve watched basketball. Now, he\u2019s got the scoring record, four rings, and other records that probably won\u2019t ever be broken. I think the longevity, too. When you play in the NBA, and you\u2019ve got to play 82 games and hopefully playoffs, and he\u2019s stayed healthy through all that and kept an enthusiasm about the game this long, I think that adds to his legacy.

On Saturday evening she announced that she would instead be returning home, and transferring to USC where she will form one of the most dynamic duos in the sport with JuJu Watkins. The move comes after Iriafen had a breakout season that saw her put up 19. 4 points and 11 rebounds per game while shooting 54. 6% from the field, highlighted by a 41-point outing against Iowa State in the NCAA Tournament. For her drastic jump in numbers, she ended up winning 2024 Pac-12 Most Improved Player of the Year. Iriafen, a Los Angeles native, had a meteoric rise in women's college basketball. She was Stanford's leading scorer, averaging 19. 4 points, 11 rebounds and 2. 3 assists while shooting 54. 6% from the field and a career-high 77. 3% on free throws as a junior this past season. She was named the Pac-12's Most Improved Player, but \"most improved\" might be underselling it. In her sophomore year, Iriafen averaged 6. 7 points, 3. 8 rebounds and 0. 5 assists per game. That's exactly the kind of help USC needs to get over the hump and win another national championship. Seeded No. 1 going into 2024 NCAA tournament, the Trojans were stopped in the Elite Eight, losing 80-73 to No. 3 UConn. Stanford underwent a lot of change this offseason. Cameron Brink, the team's second-highest scorer, was drafted No. Iriafen adds experience to this group, which though talented, potentially could need time to adjust to college and the college game. Adding Iriafen to a roster already with JuJu Watkins and Rayah Marshall will be terrifying to upcoming opponents. Like Marshall, Iriafen is a rebounding machine as both players averaged a double-double in points and rebounds last season. Combine this with Watkins, who was the top freshman in the country this year and finished second in the NCAA in scoring averaging 27. 1 points per game, and the Trojans could be unstoppable next season.

With Iriafen potentially jumping into the WNBA draft in 2025 (where she could be a No. 1 pick), she has one more chance to win a national title.

A. native, who was a McDonald's All-American at Harvard-Westlake, graduated from Stanford in three years and entered the portal soon after Stanford's legendary coach Tara VanDerveer announced her retirement. Not only do the Trojans add a dynamic post presence with Iriafen, but coach Lindsay Gottlieb continues to build a roster with local stars who can help draw growing crowds to Galen Center. Iriafen, Watkins, starting senior center Rayah Marshall (Lynwood High) and incoming freshman Kennedy Smith (Etiwanda High) are Southern California natives. Excitement surrounding Watkins helped the Trojans nearly quadruple their home attendance this season from the previous year, including a sellout against UCLA. The Bruins also added a verbal pledge from a former Pac-12 rival as Washington State guard Charlisse Leger-Walker committed to UCLA on Thursday.

The Trojans are determined to learn from their mistakes and the missteps of their peers. This offseason, USC has been hyper-focused on surrounding Watkins with the talent needed for her to be cutting down the nets in Tampa, Florida, next April. Iriafen enjoyed a breakout campaign in 2023-24 for the Cardinal, posting 19. 4 points and 11 rebounds while shooting nearly 55% from the floor. And she did all of this while playing beautifully alongside another dominant big in Cameron Brink, who was just selected by the Los Angeles Sparks at No. 2 in the WNBA Draft. 247Sports' Brandon Clay slots Iriafen at No. 2 in his transfer portal player rankings; former Oregon State star Raegan Beers, who has multiple seasons of eligibility remaining to Iriafen's one, ranks first for that reason.

Fridolina Rolfo fired home from the penalty spot with 15 minutes to play to complete the defending champions\u2019 fightback and seal a 2-1 aggregate victory, after Emma Hayes\u2019 side had been made to endure the final half-hour with 10 players following the sending-off of Kadeisha Buchanan. Barca had already levelled the tie via a deflected finish from Ballon d\u2019Or winner Aitana Bonmati by the time the Chelsea defender saw red. Reaching for a loose ball inside the centre circle, she landed a foot on the ankle of Patri Guijarro and referee Iuliana Demetrescu did not hesitate in showing a second yellow card. Leupolz is saved by the offside flag, because James is adjudged to be narrowly offside in the build-up. Her clever cutback reaches the back post and with Barcelona scrambling back across the goal, Leupolz at the back post can convert into the empty net, but she clatters the bar! GOAL!

Chelsea's Kadeisha Buchanan was sent off in the second half for a contentious second booking. And Fridolina Rolfo wrapped up Barcelona's 2-1 aggregate victory with a debatable penalty.

Although St. Brown didn't originally want to end up in Detroit, he seems pretty happy with how things worked out. \"Looking back on it, it's [for] the best,\" St. Brown said of landing in Detroit. \"I don't think there's another team where I could have done what I've done here with the people that are around me: The coaches, my teammates, the fans, the city.

The Cowboys still wanted Gallup around long-term and signed him to a five-year, $57. 5 million contract. The former Colorado State star hasn't been the same since as other Cowboys receivers overtook him on the depth chart. He caught just 39 passes for 424 yards and four scores in 2022 before posting a 34/418/2 stat line in 2023. Dallas released Gallup in March, saving $9. 5 million in cap space. While Gallup hasn't returned to his pre-torn ACL form, perhaps a change of scenery is needed. He faced much competition for targets from the likes of CeeDee Lamb, Brandin Cooks, Dalton Schultz or Jake Ferguson and more in Dallas. Perhaps a new spot where he can carve out a new role and thrive is exactly what's needed. It's a good thing that Amon-Ra St. Brown didn't get his way during the 2021 NFL Draft. Otherwise, the Lions star receiver would have never ended up in Detroit. During a recent interview, St. Brown actually admitted that the Lions were the ONE team that he didn't want to play for going into the NFL Draft. At the time, St. Brown was hoping that the Packers would draft him so that he could play on the same team as his brother, Equanimeous St. Brown. However, if Green Bay wasn't willing to take him, then his second option was ANYONE but the Lions.

St. Brown was taken in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. It ended up being a home run pick by the franchise. However, St. Brown recently admitted that he was hoping he\u2019d land in Green Bay. \u201cWhen it got to Day 3, I was already mad,\u201d St. Brown told ESPN\u2019s Eric Woodyard. \u201cI even told my brother [Equanimeous], \u2018If there\u2019s one team I don\u2019t want to go to, that\u2019s the Lions.

Despite success at a top program and a solid frame, St. Brown saw his stock dip in the pre-draft process. His 40-yard dash time of 4. 61 seconds raised some questions, as did his mediocre agility drill times. None of that mattered once St. Brown got into the league. He\u2019s already a two-time Pro Bowler and 2023 first-team All-Pro in three seasons. In 49 games, he has already logged 315 receptions for 3,588 yards and 21 touchdowns. The Lions even rewarded him with a four-year, $120 million extension this offseason, locking him in for years to come.

His shooting from distance fell off a bit and his handle was a bit looser than I\u2019d seen at lower levels, which prevented him from getting into the paint as consistently as someone with his tools should. While I don\u2019t think Carlyle is wired to be a true point guard, his demeanor is fantastic. He\u2019s relentless and aggressive in constantly attacking the rim, and while Stanford\u2019s defense was messy, I always thought he was tough and willing to crawl into his opponent\u2019s space. If he gets his pull-up jumper back to where it was to start this season, he can be the kind of three-level collegiate scorer who makes a high-major all-conference team at some point.

Williams is said to have dreamed about being in this position for a long time, and it finally came true on Thursday when the Chicago Bears selected him with the No. 1 overall pick. It's a dream come true, but the work has just started for the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner. It won't be easy, as every rookie quarterback has gone through struggles. However, Williams is confident that as long as he's himself, he will be just fine. The 22-year-old told reporters in Chicago, including Dan Wiederer of The Chicago Tribune. \"I don't think about it, to be honest with you,\" Williams said. \"I think about just doing my job, handling the things I can handle, dealing with the small things, holding everybody accountable and everybody holding me accountable. The former Clemson receiver was unpopular in Green Bay, having eight receptions and seven fumbles during his time with the Packers. Fans will wonder how things would have been different with St. Brown instead of Rodgers. Amon-Ra St. Brown\u2019s Path to Stardom It may have taken St. Brown a while to hear his name called in the draft. However, once he got into the league, he became an almost overnight sensation. St. Brown was a 5-star recruit coming out of high school in California. He could have gone to virtually any school, but decided to stay close to home to play for the USC Trojans. USC played St. Brown immediately as a true freshman, and he produced right away. Thomas Yassmin, TE, Utah \u2014 Denver Broncos, free agent. \u2014 Denver Broncos, free agent.

That warning went unheeded. AMON-RA Amon-Ra St. Brown was a No. 112 pick a few years ago at the NFL draft. He waited until Day 3. He almost led the Detroit Lions to the Super Bowl. This should have convinced NFL teams that USC receivers are not to be underestimated. St. Brown always looked the part of a good pro receiver.

The 6\u20193, 320 pound blocker began his college career at Cornell, leading the top offensive line in the Ivy League. Nourzad joined the Big Red in 2018, but burst onto the scene in 2021. At right tackle, the Marietta, Georgia native earned All-American honors, and was named Phil Steele\u2019s Ivy League Offensive Lineman of the Year. Additionally, Nourzad was 2021 first-team All-Ivy and a semifinalist for the William V. Campbell Trophy. With Nourzad, Cornell\u2019s 2021 offensive line allowed just 0. 9 sacks per game, which was the best in the Ivy League, and 5th best in the NCAA. After Cornell, Nourzad transferred to Penn State for the final 2 seasons of his collegiate career. Now, the center position becomes a need for a veteran to provide some insurance in the middle of the offensive line. \"He's never done anything wrong,\" DeBoer said of Brailsford. \"It's nothing like that.

Thanks to Abel\u2019s designation, families and children will receive the food they so desperately need. \u201d The Weeknd, appointed a Goodwill Ambassador in October 2021, has actively supported WFP\u2019s global hunger-relief mission through personal donations and the XO Humanitarian Fund established in partnership with World Food Program USA, the organisation detailed. The singer, his partners and fans have raised $6. 5 million for the Fund, directing $4. 5 million toward Gaza operations. Following Israel\u2019s brutal retaliation after Hamas attacks on October 7, over 34,388 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and 1,170 Israelis have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian and Israeli sources. Israeli aggression over the past six months has triggered a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the UN warning that famine is imminent. The XO Humanitarian Fund provided 820 metric tons of food, which could feed more than $173,000 Palestinians for two weeks. The Weeknd became a WFP Goodwill Ambassador in October 2021, and set up his XO Humanitarian Fund with the World Food Program USA in March 2022. The Fund, the Weeknd\u2019s partners, and fans have raised $6. 5 million to date to provide relief to people with limited access to food. The four-time Grammy winner has also donated $2 million to Ethiopian women and children, as part of WFP\u2019s emergency food assistance program. Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7. After Hamas militants launched an attack on Israel, 300,000 Israeli troops swelled around Gaza cutting off access to food, water, and gas. Social image 2 WFP\u2019s ongoing efforts involve distributing food in U. N. shelters, communities, and camps, including specialized nutritional products. They aim to support over 100 community kitchens and provide 500,000 hot meals daily, while also aiding in the reactivation of local food systems. Since becoming a Goodwill Ambassador in 2021, Tesfaye has been actively involved in WFP\u2019s mission, raising $6. 5 million through personal donations and the XO Humanitarian Fund. His contributions to Gaza operations total $4. 5 million, with an additional $2 million allocated to emergency food assistance in Ethiopia. \u201cWe are very grateful for Abel\u2019s continued support as WFP works to respond to the urgent hunger crisis in Gaza,\u201d said Barron Segar, President and CEO, World Food Program USA. \u201cHunger is a human-made problem, and as such, it is solvable..\n\nQuestion: Who is making an urgent appeal to fans to donate towards WFP's efforts in this Palestine?\nAnswers:\nA.

Some of Mitchell's DFL colleagues embraced her on the floor. When the Senate returned from recess, Republicans offered a motion to prohibit any member who's been charged with a crime of violence from voting on bills until the chamber's ethics committee has weighed in on their case. Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, ruled Nelson\u2019s motion out of order.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (GRAY) \u2013 Minnesota State Senator Nicole Mitchell (DFL-Woodbury) returned to the Senate Floor on Monday, sparking a long day of discussion in the chamber. Republicans motioned twice to remove her ability to vote until the ethics subcommittee issues a review of her conduct. The senator is facing charges of first-degree felony burglary after allegedly breaking into her step-mother\u2019s Detroit Lakes home last Monday. She didn\u2019t appear in the senate on Wednesday or Thursday of last week, and in her absence, the body did not vote on any legislation. In her return, Mitchell did not address the media, nor did she speak for the entirety of the floor session\u2014a session which revolved largely around her presence. Senator Carla Nelson (R-Rochester) initially motioned to directly prohibit Mitchell from voting until the ethics probe is complete. Zach Duckworth, R-Lakeville. \u201cThe question is, \u2018Do we have the moral compass to do so?\u201d The motion was opposed by Senate Democrats, who hold a 34-33 majority and rely on Mitchell\u2019s vote to pass legislation over Republican objections. \u201cWe should just get on with doing the work of the people of Minnesota,\u201d said Sen.

Mitchell and their right to representation in our Democratic processes,\u201d DFL Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy told reporters after the session. \u201cIf we were to pass legislation with the full participation of a member charged like this and only with that member\u2019s support \u2026 (it) would put all of our work under a cloud,\u201d Nelson said on the floor. \u201cWe should uphold the integrity of the body and ensure that we are not passing critical legislation with the deciding vote being under such scrutiny. \u201d Senators debated the motion for about an hour, with DFL senators coming to Mitchell\u2019s defense, arguing that she needs to continue to vote so she can represent her 80,000 constituents. Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, said the Senate doesn\u2019t have the authority to \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d voters and prohibit Mitchell from voting, and he criticized Nelson\u2019s motion to strip Mitchell\u2019s voting capabilities. ST. PAUL \u2014 State Sen. Nicole Mitchell returned to the Capitol on Monday, a week after a burglary arrest threw her political career into doubt and also threatened to upend her party\u2019s session agenda. She checked in as present as the Senate convened for the week. Last week, she didn\u2019t appear in public. Mitchell declined to answer questions from reporters on Monday. Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, faces pressure to clear up the circumstances around a reported break-in at a relative\u2019s home. Republicans have called on her to resign. Democrats have also moved to create some distance from her troubles, including moving her desk to a far corner of the chamber. A spokesperson for the Senate DFL said she was moved because her former desk neighbor is on an Ethics Committee that will review Mitchell\u2019s conduct. After Nelson\u2019s Motion failed, Senator Steve Drazkowski (R-Mazeppa) motioned to prohibit the secretary of the senate from recording Mitchell\u2019s votes. Drazkowski\u2019s motion met the same fate as Nelson\u2019s. In both votes, Mitchell\u2019s vote broke the tie. When the body finally got around to debating legislation, several bills passed without any additional discussion of Mitchell\u2019s presence. Following the passage of the Omnibus Jobs Bill, Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson entered into the senate record a letter of protest and dissent. The bill passed along party lines, and Johnson believed that Senator Mitchell should not be the deciding vote. \u201cSenate Republicans do not believe that she should be voting on the floor.

The Lions and GM Brad Holmes dealt away two 2025 picks as part of trades over the draft weekend. Most notably, the Lions traded away their third-round pick in 2025 to the New York Jets in order to select British Columbia OL Giovanni Manu with the 126th overall pick near the end of the fourth round of the 2024 draft. That was a straight deal that involved no 2024 draft assets.

This is another Campbell-type player who\u2019s willing to do whatever he\u2019s asked -- and do it with his ears pinned back. If Vaki isn\u2019t playing defense, he\u2019s going to have to be incredible on special teams to be worthy of what the Lions paid. But Holmes has earned the benefit of the doubt. Next year\u2019s picks By coming one play away from the Super Bowl, the Lions officially entered a win-now window, and that was reflected in Holmes\u2019 draft aggression. Four of the Lions\u2019 six picks were made after Holmes traded up, and when the dust settled, Detroit was left without its third- and fourth-round selections for next year. That might not sound like a big deal, but Holmes has turned those mid-round selections into the likes of Amon-Ra St. Brown, Kerby Joseph, Alim McNeill, and Ifeatu Melifonwu during his time in Detroit..\n\nQuestion: What picks did this NFL team trade away in the 2025 NFL draft?\nAnswers:\nA. third-round and fourth-round picks\nB. fifth-round pick\nC. first-round pick\nD. second-round pick\nE.

The New England Patriots made some noise in the fourth round of the NFL draft by using a pick they got in a trade with the Los Angeles Chargers on former UCF star receiver Javon Baker. After failing to land a true No. 1 veteran receiving target, the Patriots set their eyes on the draft to upgrade the skilled positions around their new rookie quarterback, Drake Maye. Baker is an explosive playmaker capable of working both outside and inside. He\u2019s also tremendous in contested catch situations.

Back at the 2023 NFL trade deadline, the Lions acquired WR Donovan Peoples-Jones from the Cleveland Browns in exchange for Detroit\u2019s sixth-round pick in 2025.

After playing one season at Missouri, he transferred to LSU where he was a 2022 third-team All-American and had a standout career. However, a further glance indicates that Wingo offers scheme flexibility and versatility that will be an asset for the Lions' defensive line going forward. \"I think his character speaks for itself.

While his fight lasted only 60 seconds, Mike Perry could be out as long as 60 days for a gash suffered in exchanges with fellow former UFC fighter Thiago Alves, whom he defeated in a minute by TKO. Main card combatants Todd Duffee and Lorenzo Hunt, who both appeared to suffer injuries as a result of knockdowns early in their bouts, face longer-term suspensions. According to the full list of medical suspensions MMA Junkie acquired Monday from California State Athletic Commission executive director Andy Foster, Duffee will be out 180 days or until cleared by a neck/shoulder specialist and/or neurologist after he waved off his own fight vs. Ben Rothwell. Hunt suffered a gruesome arm contortion against Mick Terrill, which the CSAC qualified as an elbow injury. \u201cS***! Thank you, man. I know you see it,\u201d Perry said after knocking out UFC veteran Thiago Alves in 60 seconds at BKFC KnuckleMania 4. \u201cWe all love Conor McGregor\u2019s fights. I mean, he\u2019s the biggest combat sports star in history. Conor McGregor, nobody moved that needle like him. \u201cThe Irish fan base is like the number one combat sports fan base because they travel across the world to come and see Conor McGregor all the time. \u201cI remember still to this day when he knocked out Jose Aldo and what I thought about it. \u201cI can look at those things and respect those things because I\u2019m out here trying to do those things, too.

On Saturday night (April 27), \u2018Platinum\u2019 earned his fifth-straight victory under the BKFC banner, scoring a smashing 60-second TKO over former UFC standout Thiago Alves in the KnuckleMania IV main event. Immediately following the bout, Perry delivered a fiery post-fight promo targeting longtime rival Darren Till. \u201cDarren Till you fat f*cking b*tch, get your ass over here,\u201d Perry said immediately following his latest win. Perry\u2019s comments extended into the post-fight press conference, telling Till that he needs to stop chasing gold in MMA and come get a piece of \u2018Platinum\u2019 inside the squared circle. \u201cI think that fight is something a lot of people have wanted for a long time, including me and him, you know, he\u2019s talking big sh*t,\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe\u2019s talking his sh*t, but he ain\u2019t doing nothing. \u201cLook, we\u2019re partners with Conor McGregor. Everybody in the combat sports world, everybody in the world, knows who that guy is. So Conor, thank you, and let\u2019s blow this s*** up. \u201d Bare Knuckle FC is the flagship promotion in bare-knuckle boxing, and its events frequently feature former UFC fighters. In Saturday\u2019s main event, Perry stopped Alves to go 5-0 in the sport. The American also holds wins bare-knuckle boxing wins over ex-UFC champions Eddie Alvarez and Luke Rockhold. After Perry beat Rockhold last year, McGregor entered the ring to face off with \u201cPlatinum\u201d. McGregor has not fought since July 2021, when he suffered a broken leg in his second straight loss to Dustin Poirier. The Irishman, 35, is due to return to the cage on 29 June, facing Michael Chandler in the main event of UFC 303. BKFC\u2019s \u201cKing of Violence\u201d Mike Perry has yet to find his match in bareknuckle competition and certainly wants to find it. Perry (5-0 BKFC) finished Thiago Alves in the first round of the KnuckleMania 4 main event in Los Angeles, sending the former BKFC champ and fellow UFC veteran into retirement. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the opportunity that I had tonight to face him, the \u2018Pitbull,'\u201d Perry told reporters at a post-fight news conference. \u201cThere was a time, if you look on YouTube, there was a fight that I had where they called me Mike \u2018Pitbull\u2019 Perry.

Perry\u2019s comments extended into the post-fight press conference, telling Till that he needs to stop chasing gold in MMA and come get a piece of \u2018Platinum\u2019 inside the squared circle. \u201cI think that fight is something a lot of people have wanted for a long time, including me and him, you know, he\u2019s talking big sh*t,\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe\u2019s talking his sh*t, but he ain\u2019t doing nothing. BKFC\u2019s \u201cKing of Violence\u201d Mike Perry has yet to find his match in bareknuckle competition and certainly wants to find it. Perry (5-0 BKFC) finished Thiago Alves in the first round of the KnuckleMania 4 main event in Los Angeles, sending the former BKFC champ and fellow UFC veteran into retirement. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the opportunity that I had tonight to face him, the \u2018Pitbull,'\u201d Perry told reporters at a post-fight news conference. \u201cThere was a time, if you look on YouTube, there was a fight that I had where they called me Mike \u2018Pitbull\u2019 Perry. That was only that one time. Of course, I respect Thiago, and I mean, he was a champion here, so it was an honor to fight against him. \u201cI tried to let him know I was coming for him. \u201cS***! Thank you, man. I know you see it,\u201d Perry said after knocking out UFC veteran Thiago Alves in 60 seconds at BKFC KnuckleMania 4. \u201cWe all love Conor McGregor\u2019s fights. I mean, he\u2019s the biggest combat sports star in history. Conor McGregor, nobody moved that needle like him. \u201cThe Irish fan base is like the number one combat sports fan base because they travel across the world to come and see Conor McGregor all the time. \u201cI remember still to this day when he knocked out Jose Aldo and what I thought about it. \u201cI can look at those things and respect those things because I\u2019m out here trying to do those things, too. BKFC KnuckleMania 4 brought the carnage Saturday at Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, the medical suspension report shows. While his fight lasted only 60 seconds, Mike Perry could be out as long as 60 days for a gash suffered in exchanges with fellow former UFC fighter Thiago Alves, whom he defeated in a minute by TKO. Main card combatants Todd Duffee and Lorenzo Hunt, who both appeared to suffer injuries as a result of knockdowns early in their bouts, face longer-term suspensions. According to the full list of medical suspensions MMA Junkie acquired Monday from California State Athletic Commission executive director Andy Foster, Duffee will be out 180 days or until cleared by a neck/shoulder specialist and/or neurologist after he waved off his own fight vs. Ben Rothwell. Hunt suffered a gruesome arm contortion against Mick Terrill, which the CSAC qualified as an elbow injury. \u201cLook, we\u2019re partners with Conor McGregor. Everybody in the combat sports world, everybody in the world, knows who that guy is. So Conor, thank you, and let\u2019s blow this s*** up. \u201d Bare Knuckle FC is the flagship promotion in bare-knuckle boxing, and its events frequently feature former UFC fighters. In Saturday\u2019s main event, Perry stopped Alves to go 5-0 in the sport. The American also holds wins bare-knuckle boxing wins over ex-UFC champions Eddie Alvarez and Luke Rockhold. After Perry beat Rockhold last year, McGregor entered the ring to face off with \u201cPlatinum\u201d. McGregor has not fought since July 2021, when he suffered a broken leg in his second straight loss to Dustin Poirier. The Irishman, 35, is due to return to the cage on 29 June, facing Michael Chandler in the main event of UFC 303..\n\nQuestion: Who did this Fighter defeat in the main event at KnuckleMania 4?\nAnswers:\nA.

Supreme Court. Folwell first took office in early 2017 and almost immediately ended the State Health Plan's coverage for gender-affirming care. In his statement Monday he attributed that decision to concerns over costs \u2014 an argument the appellate judges explicitly rejected in their ruling. \"The plan is facing the real risk of looming insolvency,\" Folwell wrote. \"Accordingly, the plan cannot be everything for everyone. Our priority is to provide coverage that does the most good for the highest number of people with the finite resources we have available. \" The state made similar arguments in court. Monday's ruling said the government can't cite cost concerns as a reason to treat some people differently than others, calling that argument \"a non-starter. \" The LGBTQ rights group Lambda Legal represented the winning plaintiffs in court. \u201d according to the federal case. Anderson argued in the federal lawsuit that the coverage exclusion discriminates against transgender people in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Medicaid Act and the Affordable Care Act. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state from denying \u201cto any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \u201d The appeals court majority ruled, The North Carolina State Health Plan and the West Virginia Medicaid Program discriminate on the basis of gender identity and sex in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \u201d Dissenting judges countered, \u201cIn the majority\u2019s haste to champion plaintiffs\u2019 cause, today\u2019s result oversteps the bounds of the law. The majority asserts that the challenged exclusions use medical diagnosis as a proxy for transgender persons, despite the complete lack of evidence for this claim. They claimed only a subset of transgender people suffer from gender dysphoria, a diagnosis of distress over gender identity that does not match a person\u2019s assigned sex. Before offering pharmaceutical or surgical intervention, medical guidelines call for thorough psychological assessments to confirm gender dysphoria before starting any treatment. In his opinion, Gregory said that in his view, gender dysphoria is \u201cso intimately related to transgender status as to be virtually indistinguishable from it. \u201d \u201cWe hold that gender dysphoria, a diagnosis inextricable from transgender status, is a proxy for transgender identity,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cAnd coverage exclusions that bar treatments for gender dysphoria bar treatments on the basis of transgender identity by proxy. \u201d Unlike North Carolina, West Virginia has covered hormone therapy and other pharmaceutical treatments for transgender people since 2017. As of November, the 541 SHP participants who receive gender-affirming care represent 0. 007% of the overall membership of nearly 750,000. The plan\u2019s 2023 expenditures for those beneficiaries was $1. 5 million, compared with overall expenses of $3. 78 billion, both through Nov. 30. According to The Associated Press, the Richmond, Va. , appeals court becomes the first to make such a ruling involving state health plans. Because of the precedent-setting potential of the ruling, 38 state attorneys general \u2014 21 supporting the appeal and 17 against \u2014 weighed in through filing amicus briefs. It is likely the ruling will be appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court. The State Health Plan is North Carolina\u2019s largest purchaser of medical and pharmaceutical services and is self-funded. It covers about 750,000 teachers, state employees, legislators, retirees and their dependents. The N. C. State Health Plan has been ordered by a federal Appeals Court to cover gender-affirming care for members and family members. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s order, posted Monday, upholds two lower court rulings by an 8-6 margin with the voting along political lines in the cultural war healthcare issue. The full 15-member court heard arguments on the case in September after it was combined with a case involving coverage of gender-affirming surgery by West Virginia Medicaid. According to a statement from state Treasurer Dale Folwell, the state health plan\u2019s refusal to cover surgical and hormonal treatments related to the diagnosis of gender dysphoria dates back to the 1990s. North Carolina and West Virginia's transgender care coverage policies discriminate, judges rule CHARLESTON, W. Va. -- West Virginia and North Carolina's refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory, a federal appeals court ruled Monday in a case likely headed to the U. S. Supreme Court. The Richmond-based 4th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 8-6 in the case involving coverage of gender-affirming care by North Carolina's state employee health plan and the coverage of gender-affirming surgery by West Virginia Medicaid. After the ruling, West Virginia plaintiff Shauntae Anderson, a Black transgender woman and West Virginia Medicaid participant, called her state's refusal to cover her care \"deeply dehumanizing.

West Virginia and North Carolina\u2019s refusal to cover certain healthcare for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory, a federal appeals court ruled Monday in a case likely headed to the U. S. Supreme Court. The Richmond-based 4th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 8-6 in the case involving coverage of gender-affirming care by North Carolina\u2019s state employee health plan and the coverage of gender-affirming surgery by West Virginia Medicaid. \u201cThe coverage exclusions facially discriminate on the basis of sex and gender identity, and are not substantially related to an important government interest,\u201d Judge Roger Gregory, first appointed by former President Clinton and reappointed by former President George W. Bush, wrote in the majority opinion. \u201d Lambda Legal senior counsel Tara Borelli, the lead lawyer on both lawsuits, said the appellate court\u2019s decision \u201cwill save lives. \u201d \u201cIt confirms that discriminating against transgender people by denying critical medical care is not only wrong, but unconstitutional,\u201d Borelli said. \u201cNo one should be denied essential health care, but our clients in both cases were denied coverage for medically necessary care prescribed by their doctors just because they\u2019re transgender. \u201d Julia McKeown, who is transgender and an associate professor at the College of Education at N. C. State University, said that \u201cas government employees, all we want is equal access to healthcare, but we were denied just because we are transgender. Both the North Carolina and West Virginia programs receive federal funding and, applying the same reasoning as it did in its Equal Protection analysis, the court found that refusing gender-affirming care when the individual is transgender is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by that Act. The majority opinion also dealt with important subsidiary issues such as certifying a plaintiff class action, the wording of the injunctions the district courts issued requiring the state programs not to enforce their exclusionary provisions, and rulings on admission or exclusion of \u201cexpert testimony\u201d that the states wanted to present to support their defense of the exclusions. Judge Richardson\u2019s dissent was joined in whole or in part by all the other dissenters. Judge Roger L. Gregory, an appointee of President Clinton, wrote for the majority that the restrictions were \u201cobviously discriminatory\u201d based on both sex and gender. The decision came from a set of cases out of North Carolina and West Virginia, where state officials argued that their policies were based on cost concerns rather than bias. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected that argument, saying the plans were discriminating against trans people in need of treatment.

It is likely the ruling will be appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court. The State Health Plan is North Carolina\u2019s largest purchaser of medical and pharmaceutical services and is self-funded. It covers about 750,000 teachers, state employees, legislators, retirees and their dependents. A federal appeals court ruled that North Carolina\u2019s state health insurance plan discriminated against transgender patients by not covering gender-affirming care. Transgender state workers sued the state in 2019 over a coverage exclusion in the State Health Plan for treatments for gender dysphoria, the medical term for distress occurring when someone\u2019s physical sex doesn\u2019t match their gender identity. The 4th Circuit U. S. Court of Appeals sided with the workers on Monday, finding that the exclusion violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U. S. Constitution by discriminating on the basis of gender identity and sex. The case could be appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court. Defendants in the case, which included state Treasurer Dale Folwell, argued that the exclusion did not specifically target transgender people because it applied to everyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The 4th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling on Monday requiring state health insurance plans to pay for gender transition surgeries, a decision that comes amid a nationwide struggle over transgender healthcare policy. The ruling came in a set of cases in West Virginia and North Carolina, in which state officials justified not covering the surgeries, including double mastectomies and vaginoplasties, on the basis of cost rather than on considerations related to gender identity and expression. In the majority opinion, Judge Roger Gregory called the restrictions \u201cobviously discriminatory\u201d based on both sex and gender. West Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program has banned \u201ctranssexual surgeries\u201d by law since 2004. In 2020, a class action suit was filed on behalf of trans-identified Medicaid recipients in the state to challenge the law. Judge Roger L.

(Getty Image) The North Carolina State Employee Health Plan\u2019s exclusion of gender-affirming care for transgender employees and their families is discriminatory, the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. The 8-6 ruling Monday affirmed a lower court decision that the state violated the rights of state employees who use the state health plan by denying gender-affirming care for people with gender dysphoria. \u201cIn addition to discriminating on the basis of gender identity, the exclusions discriminate on the basis of sex,\u201d Judge Roger Gregory wrote for the majority. Lambda Legal and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund filed the lawsuit in 2019 challenging the exclusions on behalf of seven plaintiffs. North Carolina can no longer refuse to cover gender-affirming care for state employees or their family members on the State Health Plan, a federal appeals court ruled Monday. On Monday the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that it's unconstitutional for state-run health plans to not cover medically necessary care simply due to someone's gender identity. \"The coverage exclusions facially discriminate on the basis of sex and gender identity, and are not substantially related to an important government interest,\" the court wrote. More than 750,000 people get their health insurance through the State Health Plan. It's unknown how many are transgender, but in 2022 a national study estimated that fewer than 1% of North Carolina adults identified as transgender. A federal appeals court ruled on Monday that state health insurance plans must provide coverage for gender-affirming care in North Carolina and West Virginia. Trans advocates say it's a huge victory, especially since bills restricting the rights of transgender people have been on the rise in state legislatures. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. , issued its decision about two cases. One was brought by North Carolina state employees and their dependents who are transgender and were unable to get coverage for gender-affirming care. The other lawsuit came from West Virginians who are transgender and on Medicaid. They could get coverage for some treatments \u2014 like hormones \u2014 but not for surgery. These cases were heard last fall by the 4th circuit en banc \u2014 that is, all the judges on that appeals court heard the argument. The N. C. State Health Plan has been ordered by a federal Appeals Court to cover gender-affirming care for members and family members. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s order, posted Monday, upholds two lower court rulings by an 8-6 margin with the voting along political lines in the cultural war healthcare issue. The full 15-member court heard arguments on the case in September after it was combined with a case involving coverage of gender-affirming surgery by West Virginia Medicaid.

Lambda Legal and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund filed the lawsuit in 2019 challenging the exclusions on behalf of seven plaintiffs. Background In December 2016, Democratic state Treasurer Janet Cowell and the SHP board voted to allow coverage for a year, citing projected federal regulatory changes. The board vote took place three weeks before Folwell began his first term as treasurer on Jan. 1, 2017. The SHP, under Folwell\u2019s guidance, allowed the coverage to expire in 2017. In June 2022, Judge Loretta Biggs of the Middle District of N. C. ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. Biggs\u2019 order required the SHP to resume coverage that day, including paying for medical treatments, such as hormone therapy and surgeries, for transgender individuals. Biggs determined the SHP\u2019s refusal to cover medical care related to gender transition \u201cdiscriminates based on sex and transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U. S. A federal appeals court ruled that North Carolina\u2019s state health insurance plan discriminated against transgender patients by not covering gender-affirming care.

The Milwaukee Bucks' injury woes have worsened during their first-round series with the Indiana Pacers. All-Star point guard Damian Lillard has been diagnosed with a Grade 1 Achilles tendon strain and will miss Game 4 on Sunday, the team announced. Giannis Antetokounmpo has not played since April 9 due to a lingering calf strain. Late in the fourth quarter of their heartbreaking overtime loss in Game 3, the Bucks were trying to foul to extend the game when Lillard re-aggravated his Achilles.

While Lillard remained in the game the rest of the way, he did not take a shot in the extra frame. \"Honestly, Dame was really struggling,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after Game 3. The Milwaukee Bucks are even more short-handed, with their season now hanging by a thread following a gut-punching addition to their already worrisome injury report.

That was evident as he poured in a record-setting 35 points in the first half of Game 1. In the other five halves in this series, though, he has a combined 62 points on 16-of-46 (34. 7%) from the field. As a result, the Bucks have dropped Games 2 and 3 and now find themselves down 2-1 in the series. A hampered Lillard is the last thing the Bucks need in the circumstances.

According to NBA insider Shams Charania of The Athletic and The Stadium, Bucks superstar guard Damian Lillard is listed as 'doubtful' for Game 4. He suffered a strained Achilles and is in a walking boot following the team's Game 3 loss. Charania tweeted out the news early Saturday.

Watch as Lillard limps as he's on his way to pick up teammate Patrick Beverley from the floor. So making sure we lean on them. \u201cJust making sure that we don\u2019t let those things mentally let us off the hook. It\u2019s the playoffs. Everyone\u2019s dealing with something, on our side, on their side, how do we fight through it? How do we find ways to win one game, win a battle? Overall, the series will be the war, but try to win a battle on Sunday and make sure we do it together and make sure we pick each other up with whatever it might be. \u201d If the Bucks are going to pull off a major upset without Antetokounmpo and Lillard, the Bucks are going to have to play with real purpose on both ends. Defensively, it will be simple to build on Game 3. They gave up 32 second-chance points on 19 offensive rebounds by the Pacers. This play starts with a pick-and-roll between Middleton and Portis, but the initial action is just a decoy to get post position for Portis on the left block, his favorite spot on the floor.

On Saturday, Rivers told reporters he believed the Pacers\u2019 pressure forced the Bucks to post Portis up on the \u201cwrong\u201d side, the right block, far too often in Game 3. \u201d When the Bucks don\u2019t take the right shots and force the wrong ones, the Pacers take advantage of it on the other end with easy buckets in transition. If Antetokounmpo and Lillard are unable to play Sunday, the Bucks will have to be careful with the ball and play with purpose, only taking the shots they want to and leaning into actions for their strongest offensive players. In a normal situation, instead of the end of a quarter, the Bucks would want to get into this action sooner to give Middleton time to deal with any extra attention, such as traps or double teams, that the Pacers might send his way, but this is a purposeful set. The Pacers have worked to deny Middleton the ball all series long, so one of the easiest ways to get him a touch is setting a screen. It leaves Khris Middleton as the last of the Big Three standing, and though Middleton scored a career-high 42 points in the Game 3 loss he is still managing a right ankle sprain he suffered in Game 2. In 23 career playoff games, Middleton has scored 30 or more points 12 times. At various points in their Bucks careers Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis have had monster offensive games, but the Bucks will need contributions from Pat Connaughton, Malik Beasley, Pat Beverley, AJ Green and Andre Jackson Jr. The Bucks bench has been outscored 51-24 in the last two games. \"A lot of teams in the NBA when their star players are out, the game is a little bit different,\" Beasley said. \"There's a lot more ball movement obviously because they're guys who handle the ball.

But, if these AI-assisted expansions of their project are successful, Dr. Lu said that the reduction in this time-consuming human verification work will help the institute adapt THOR's process for much more vast and expansive astronomy datasets, like those coming soon from the Vera C.

Taking on that role has been the culmination of a lifetime fascination with the question of life and the Universe, a fascination that formed when I was a kid in the 1970s, drinking deep from the well of science fiction novels, UFO documentaries and Star Trek reruns. Early on, as a teenager reading both Carl Sagan and Erich von D\u00e4niken (the author of Chariots of the Gods), I had to figure out how to separate the wheat from the chaff. This served as a kind of training ground for dealing with questions facing me and my colleagues about proper standards of evidence in astrobiology. It\u2019s also why, as a public-facing scientist, I must work to understand how people not trained in science come to questions surrounding UFOs as aliens. Asteroid Institute and Google Cloud Identify 27,500 New Asteroids with Cloud-Based Astrodynamics and Data Mining MILL VALLEY, Calif. and SUNNYVALE, Calif. , April 30, 2024 \u2014 Asteroid Institute, a program of B612 Foundation, and Google Cloud today announced the most significant results of their partnership to date: identifying 27,500 new, high-confidence asteroid discovery candidates. The work, which took place over several weeks, has the potential to enable the mapping of the solar system and protect the Earth from collisions, advancing the field of minor planet discovery. The project was done without the benefit of new observations of the sky, but rather by leveraging Google Cloud technology to run sophisticated algorithms developed by Asteroid Institute and University of Washington researchers, and by mining historical datasets from the NOIRLab Source Catalog Data Release 2 (NSC DR2). B612 Asteroid Institute/University of Washington DiRAC Institute/OpenSpace Project 4 \u201cThis is a sea change\u201d in how astronomical research will be conducted, according to researcher Ed Lu. Christopher P. Michel However, THOR works by connecting a tiny dot of light observed in one image with its corresponding dot in a different photograph, deducing that they\u2019re the same object and effectively predicting their flight path. The National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, or NOIRLab, houses 412,000 images in its digital archives, some of which depict 1. 7 billion dots of light, the New York Times reported. Using Google Cloud, THOR was able to identify all the previously overlooked cosmic bodies within about five weeks. This, as per the New York Post, surpasses the total number discovered by all global telescopes last year. Among these are 100 asteroids that traverse within Earth's orbit, with the majority located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. As per the New York Post, while none of the identified objects were on collision course with earth, this proves vital data that could one day prevent potential cosmic threats. 'Sea change' in how astronomical research can be conducted Unlike traditional observation techniques that track objects across multiple images over time, THOR connects isolated points of light from different images, inferring that they represent the same object. This approach, and the results as per Ed Lu, executive director of the Asteroid Institute, represent \"a sea change\" in how astronomical research can be conducted. 'What is exciting is that we are using electrons in data centers, in addition to the usual photons in telescopes, to make astronomical discoveries,' according to Dr. Lu. The THOR algorithm was crafted by B612's Asteroid Institute in collaboration with the University of Washington's DiRAC Institute. Since 2002, retired NASA astronaut and Stanford-educated astrophysicist Dr. Ed Lu, has been an executive director of the nonprofit B612, where he now leads the group's Asteroid Institute. Above at right, a NASA photo of Dr. Lu taken during his astronaut career on October 10, 2000 Nearly 1. 7 billion points of light documented in 412,000 images from the digital archives of the US National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab) were scanned by the project's novel asteroid-hunting software.

Asteroids were behind the demise of the mighty dinosaurs, and many theories suggest they would probably be the reason for humanity's downfall. However, a groundbreaking algorithm has helped asteroid hunters identify a whopping 27,500 overlooked near-Earth asteroids, make or break information that could potentially help us avoid the doom. The THOR-like technology Known as Tracklet-less Heliocentric Orbit Recovery (THOR), the technology is revolutionising the way astronomers detect near-Earth asteroids, potentially enhancing our planetary defence capabilities. THOR, which was developed by researchers at the University of Washington and the Asteroid Institute, THOR employs a novel approach by sifting through archival space photographs to identify celestial bodies.

AI automation will be a critical step to scale this work further, because the initial verification of likely candidates is a major bottleneck\u2014currently conducted manually by volunteer high school students, undergraduate and postgraduate students, scientists, and astronomers. If successful, human verification needs may be reduced significantly and the pipelines built for NOIRLab can be adapted to run on much larger datasets, such as ones from the Vera C.

Astronomers and data scientists working with a boost in computer power on loan from Google have discovered 27,500 new asteroids, some perilously close to Earth. Their collaboration hopes to speed up the development of 'a comprehensive map of the solar system' needed for 'planetary defense,' according to one Harvard astrophysicist, Matthew Holman, who helped develop the asteroid-hunting software. Nearly 1. 7 billion points of light, documented in 412,000 infrared images from the US National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab) archives, were scanned by the project's novel 'killer asteroid'-hunting algorithm.

Exactly what happened next remains controversial, but when Arnold described the objects as moving like \u2018a saucer if you skip it across the water\u2019 he triggered a chain of events leading to one of the most outrageous misquotes in the history of journalism.

The track, which was released last Friday, is the latest chapter in the ongoing spat between Lamar and Drake \u2014 which was reignited last month when Kendrick had seemingly hit out at the Canadian artist in an uncredited verse on Future's \u2018Like That\u2019, also featuring Metro Boomin. Drake hit back with two diss tracks, the first entitled \u2018Push-ups\u2019, and then doubled down with \u2018Taylor-Made Freestyle\u2019 \u2014 in which he uses Tupac\u2019s voice to berate Kendrick for not responding to his original diss, as well as making comments about Kendrick\u2019s height. The estate\u2019s lawyer, Howard King, called the use of AI Tupac a \u201cflagrant violation of Tupac\u2019s publicity and the estate\u2019s legal rights,\u201d as well as a \u201cblatant abuse of the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time. \u201d The letter suggested potential legal action on copyright grounds, with King writing, \u201cIt is hard to believe that [Tupac\u2019s record label]\u2019s intellectual property was not scraped to create the fake Tupac AI on the Record. \u201d He then demanded Drake explain \u201chow the sound-alike was created and the persons or company that created it, including all recordings and other data \u2018scraped\u2019 or used. The late rapper's estate took issue with the song, as a letter sent by lawyer Howard King that's been obtained by PEOPLE claimed that Drake's use of his voice was a \"flagrant violation of Tupac\u2019s publicity and the estate\u2019s legal rights. \" King said \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" was a \"blatant abuse of the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time,\" insisting the estate \"would have never given its approval\" regarding the use of Tupac's vocals. Tupac performs in Chicago in March 1994. Raymond Boyd/Getty \"You personally are well acquainted both with publicity rights and the laws that protect them, and with the harm that unauthorized AI impersonations can cause to artists, including yourself,\" wrote King to Drake.

Drake hit back with two diss tracks, the first entitled \u2018Push-ups\u2019, and then doubled down with \u2018Taylor-Made Freestyle\u2019 \u2014 in which he uses Tupac\u2019s voice to berate Kendrick for not responding to his original diss, as well as making comments about Kendrick\u2019s height. \"That's supposed to be exempt from protection, meaning Drake is OK, he falls into this exception. \" Drake performs in Atlanta in December 2022.

He said his family has received many requests everyone is excited, though his kids are at \"that teenage cool age right now\" and don't show it outwardly. \"I'm flattered,\" Hyde said. New York could get an important utility man back on the field soon The New York Yankees could get an important piece of the roster back soon. New York has dealt with a wide range of injuries already this season but the team should start to get reinforcements back shortly. The Yankees' biggest injury concerns right now involve Gerrit Cole, D. J. LeMahieu, and Jasson Dom\u00ednguez, but the team has dealt with other injuries as well. One player who has missed some time already this season is utility man Jon Berti. He has appeared in just six games this season but could be back soon as he is set to begin a rehab assignment on Sunday with the Somerset Patriots, according to MLB. com's Bryan Hoch. \"(Third baseman) Jon Berti will begin a rehab assignment with (the Somerset Patriots), tomorrow, 4/28,\" Hoch said. The Martian's long-awaited debut was a bright spot in the Bronx Bombers' disappointing 2023 season. Albeit a tiny sample size, he slashed. 258/. 303/. 677 with four home runs and a stolen base in 33 plate appearances at just 20 years old. There haven't been any updates regarding Dominguez's progress since April 10 when a report came out that he was on track to begin a rehab assignment at the end of the month. At that time, he was taking swings and throwing from 120 feet. The lack of news may be slightly concerning, but if that report is correct, we could see Dominguez in pinstripes by the end of May. Make sure to keep an eye on any news that comes out soon. If it's good, pull the trigger and add him. Berti (groin) will begin a rehab assignment with Double-A Somerset on Sunday, Bryan Hoch of MLB. com reports. Berti has been down for the last two weeks with a left groin strain but is ready to play in some rehab games to show he's over the injury. Because he hasn't missed that much time, Berti probably won't need too many rehab at-bats before being activated. Twins Video On Tuesday, Pablo L\u00f3pez took the mound against the lowly Chicago White Sox in what should have been an overpowering match-up. Instead, L\u00f3pez struggled through four innings by allowing three runs on four hits with two walks. He struck out six and earned a no-decision, but there were other concerns with his performance. His final pitch in the fourth inning registered at under 92 mph, which was his slowest fastball since joining the Twins. Both Rocco Baldelli and L\u00f3pez said he is physically fine with L\u00f3pez blaming the fourth-inning issues on mentality and conviction issues. Still, it will be something for the team to track in future starts. L\u00f3pez had previously dealt with injuries before being acquired by the Twins. During the 2019 season, a shoulder injury caused him to miss over two months. 103 BA and a. 205 SLG. He\u2019s only allowed four hits (two extra-base hits) versus his fastball, throwing it nearly 200 times. L\u00f3pez\u2019s other pitches also play off his fastball, including his much-improved sweeper. He uses the pitch more regularly, and the peripheral numbers show it is getting more swings and misses. His Whiff% (37. 8) has risen, and he has gotten eight strikeouts in 21 at-bats ending on the pitch. Opponents have a. 476 SLG against it, but the xSLG is over 160 points lower. His changeup, curveball, and sinker have all been used less regularly this season, with his sinker usage dropping from 10. 6% last season to 4. 3% in 2024. He could turn to his sweeper more regularly if his fastball lacks its normal velocity, or his other offspeed offerings might get more use. But no real rehabilitation process to go through for this type of injury. \u201cThey said anywhere from three weeks to six weeks to nine weeks,\u201d said Casas. \u201cThey don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just depending on how my body\u2019s feeling. For right now, I\u2019m still in pain to breathe. My lungs are still hitting my midsection. I\u2019m still getting to 75 percent capacity without pain. So the first step is to feel good breathing before I can move to (cardiovascular activity) and then I\u2019ll move into more anaerobic exercises and then progress. But that\u2019s the first step to feeling better \u2014 breathing without pain, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m working on now. \u201d. 10, 2021, after the remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded the stadium last week. Somerset Patriots One of the things the Yankees have garnered a reputation for is maximizing pitching talent, and Brock Selvidge is another example of a prospect whom they\u2019ve developed masterfully. The left-hander was selected in the third round of the 2021 MLB Draft out of Hamilton High School, and he\u2019s currently one of the youngest pitchers in the Eastern League. He\u2019s the fifth-youngest qualified pitcher at the Double-A level, and yet he\u2019s overpowering the competition. Brock Selvidge has a 1. 71 ERA and 1. 86 FIP in four starts, striking out 29% of batters faced while keeping his groundball rate at a strong 45. 1%. The Red Sox are not sure how long they\u2019ll be without Casas, who was removed from last Saturday\u2019s game after one at-bat due to rib discomfort and diagnosed with the cartilage tear in the days after. He likened the injury to a \u201ccar crash\u201d within his body. \u201cNo ribs were fractured, so it\u2019s not a bone thing. It\u2019s more a cartilage thing.

If it was. muscle or a bone or cartilage, they\u2019re all similar timetable schedules. It\u2019s not like one\u2019s better than the other, Everything in the midsection takes a long time to heal and mend and there\u2019s a lot of torque and rotation that happens during your swing that needs to be perfect..\n\nQuestion: Who is expected to begin a rehab assignment with Double-A this Minor League Baseball Team on Sunday?\nAnswers:\nA.

Last season, Walker started 31 games for the Phillies and went 15-6 with a 4. 38 ERA with 84 earned runs allowed in 172. 2 innings of work. His 15 wins were tied for fourth most in the National League and the Phillies went 21-10 in his 31 starts (. 667 win %).

St. Louis could have an important reinforcement back on the field very soon The St. Louis Cardinals finally could have one of their important outfielders back soon. Young outfielder Dylan Carlson appeared set to be the club's starting center fielder on Opening Day but a shoulder injury toward the end of Spring Training completely changed things. With Tommy Edman sidelined, Carlson competed for the starting job with Victor Scott II and seemed to have won it before his shoulder injury. He hasn't appeared in a game yet this season but that could change very soon. Carlson reportedly will take a massive step forward and begin a minor league rehab assignment either Tuesday or Wednesday, according to MLB. com's John Denton. 10, 2021, after the remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded the stadium last week.

We're hoping he could be a story for us and have a quality year for us, especially with Anthony out. \" San\u00f3 entered Saturday with a. 352 on-base percentage, three doubles, a homer and five RBI in 21 games. The Angels are hopeful they can identify things in his swing to help him cut down on his strikeouts, but his average exit velocity is tops in the majors. \"You see the motivation and how hungry he is to get back to being what he was, if not better than what he was,\" Minasian said.

ANAHEIM, CALIF. \u2013 Miguel San\u00f3 was the most popular man before Friday's game at Angel Stadium, chatting with a few of his former teammates and coaches before he took pregame batting practice, then chatting with more familiar faces after completing his batting practice rounds. There was a lot to talk about since San\u00f3 left the Twins. He was limited to 20 games in 2022 because of a torn meniscus in his left knee and inflammation when he returned after the surgery. The Twins bought out the last year of his contract and he didn't play anywhere last summer. That could have marked the end of San\u00f3's baseball story. Instead, he lost more than 55 pounds, played well in the Dominican Winter League, earned a minor league contract with the Angels and impressed enough to become a starting third baseman. He finished fourth in Cy Young voting in the American League last season after going 12-7 with a 2. 83 ERA and 1. 043 WHIP in 30 starts, and Hyde chose him for Game 1 of the Division Series. The Orioles haven\u2019t announced their rotation for the four-game series against the Yankees at Camden Yards, but Bradish could start Wednesday on regular rest or Thursday to keep ace Corbin Burnes on his normal turn.

It's a pleasant problem to have, but also a complication with no easy resolution. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping everything open right now.

We hope the findings highlighted will lead to increased awareness and support during the perinatal period and help prevent future maternal suicides,\" said Dr. Abigail Easter, reader in perinatal mental health at King's College London, and lead investigator on the study. Al-Oraibi said the newsroom had to \"hone in on our exclusives, our original reporting\" but this meant they had to change their mindset and accept they could not cover everything. \"I have one correspondent in Jordan, I can't expect him to tell me every [thing that happened] in Jordan and still work on scoops and exclusives.

And that's really what we started doing from January. Persian Gulf tied to Iranian identity The Persian Gulf is not only a geographical location but a historic heritage with a record of thousands of years that has taken its identity from the Iranians and is also associated with the Iranian identity. Efforts to change the name of the Persian Gulf have always prompted reactions from the Iranian people because the Persian Gulf has been the most important border area of Iran throughout history, which is still standing and no effort has been able to separate it from our country. Hence, this name has become a symbol of Iranians\u2019 solidarity in modern times. The Persian Gulf is an important component in the world\u2019s political and economic equations and the security of the Persian Gulf region is also common security. 84 per 100,000 live births in the U.

Qualitative research into perinatal suicide attempts is crucial to understand the experiences and the circumstances surrounding these events, but this has largely been unexplored until now. The research, now published in BMC Psychiatry, aimed to explore the experiences of women and birthing people who had a suicide attempt in the perinatal period and to understand the context and contributing factors surrounding it. Researchers recruited 11 women and birthing people in the U. K. who self-reported as having undertaken a suicide attempt. Interviews were conducted virtually, recorded and transcribed. \"As a midwife, I have witnessed how hopeless some women felt during pregnancy or after they gave birth.

And it is frustrating, primarily because I feel it does such a disservice to our journalists on the ground. \u201d People often wrongly assume that The National\u2019s editorials have to reflect the UAE government position, she said, explaining that instead the newspaper\u2019s view on issues is decided only by four or five people sitting in a room together and it is \u201cpurely owned\u201d by them.

But there is a different culture in the UAE, Al-Oraibi explained. She arrived in Abu Dhabi with her own \"biases\" and decided to \"double down\" on the weekend and introduce a new supplement - but it wasn't picked up because a lot of The National's professional audience got the newspaper to their office rather than their homes and only read it on weekdays. The weekend edition was permanently closed during the Covid-19 pandemic with dedicated digital weekend content produced instead. Al-Oraibi said that \"was our way to compensate for not having a weekend edition, which I miss but it made no business sense\". \u201cAnd I feel like it\u2019s easy to write off outlets that come from the region because we definitely operate in a different environment. \u201d Al-Oraibi, an Iraqi-British journalist who has also lived in the US, pointed as an example to US newspapers that claim they are objective: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything\u2019s objective\u2026 So are we subjective? Yes.

The Bills drafted him with the 60th overall selection in the second round, a spot the talented former Ute had been linked to in a variety of mock drafts. For starters, he\u2019s reuniting with former Utah teammate Dalton Kincaid, a 2023 first-rounder who made a big impact as a rookie at tight end. \u201cI got to meet with them a couple of times during the combine \u2026 then having a couple Zooms throughout the process with my guy Dalton out there. I was always hoping that that would be a possibility. So super awesome when I got that call,\u201d Bishop said during his introductory press conference. The Green Bay Packers made 11 selections in the 2024 NFL draft, starting with offensive lineman Jordan Morgan at No. 25 overall in the first round and ending with cornerback Kalen King at No. 255 overall in the seventh round. It\u2019s time to break down the class. Best picks. Sleepers. Winners. Losers. Strategy. Let\u2019s dig in. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Packers\u2019 draft class in 2024:. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Who needs to draft prospects from the Power Five to build a Super Bowl contender? The Philadelphia Eagles might soon find out after taking an unconventional approach in the NFL draft. General manager Howie Roseman used a first-round pick on Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell and a third-round selection on Houston Christian linebacker Jalyx Hunt. Surely those two were on every Eagles fan\u2019s mock draft board. Only the most diehard college football fans in Philadelphia \u2014 of which there are few \u2014 and the most dogged Eagles scouts \u2014 of which there are many \u2014 had much of a report on Mitchell or Hunt. While the picks seemed outside the box, Roseman said it\u2019s not out of the ordinary to find players of that caliber out of more than 400 scouting reports that he receives. If growing pains do come around, it happens with a lot of players. You deal with it in that moment. You handle it. But I don't think about it. \" Williams will start from step one, just like he did at USC in 2022. People doubted him then, saying it would be a rebuilding year for USC and that their chances of making the College Football Playoff were dim. Instead, Williams and his team shocked the college football world, recording an 11-1 record and being one win shy of making the College Football Playoff. The former All-American will look to shock the football world once again and lead the Bears to new heights right out of the gate. It won't be easy, but Williams was selected No. 1 overall to do the impossible. Grade: A Round 5, Pick 155: Jeremiah Trotter Jr. , LB, Clemson This was my favorite pick of the draft, and if you\u2019re an Eagles fan, it probably was for you, too. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. played high school football at St. Joe\u2019s Prep in Philadelphia. Oh, and his father, Jeremiah Trotter, is in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame. People will talk about him being undersized, or he did not test as well in this test or that test for the combine or his pro day, I get it. You have to go through the process, and some things matter more than others. However, I also believe in everything happening for a reason, and the Eagles getting Trotter, who will wear No. 54 like his father did \u2013 it\u2019s perfect. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. \ud83d\udc4f  \ud83d\udcfa: 2024 #NFLDraft on NFL Network/ESPN/ABC pic. twitter. com/qsFoCVcBWy \u2014 Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) April 27, 2024 After the announcement, Flores\u2019 girlfriend who accompanied him on the trip, celebrated the announcement and the efforts of the mechanical engineer who became a Cowboys fan thanks to the influence of his late father. Advertisement Flores\u2019 father, Luis Antonio Flores, launched Cowboys Nation Mx, a social media platform devoted to providing news, videos, photographs, analysis and commentary for the franchise\u2019s fans in Mexico. When his father died, Eduardo took over the operation. \u201cWhen my dad left, part of me went with him,\u201d Flores said. \u201cI was left with nobody to talk about the Cowboys. \u201d Thomas was the 233rd overall pick. Finally, PFF has Kenneth Grant being selected in the first round and teaming up with LaDarius Henderson and Nico Collins on the Texans. 20. HOUSTON TEXANS: DI KENNETH GRANT, MICHIGAN The Texans aren\u2019t missing much on their defense, but defensive tackle stands out as a potential weakness. Michigan\u2019s Kenneth Grant is a potential solution. He earned an 80. 4 overall grade last season. He and Mason Graham could be the best interior pair in college football next season. The big question mark for Michigan football in 2024 isn\u2019t the talent \u2014 clearly, there are a lot of high-end players. Donovan Edwards, should he return to form, Rod Moore, coming off of an ACL injury, and perhaps someone like Derrick Moore or Josh Priebe could find themselves with their names called either on day one or day two next year. Boomer Esiason announced Monday he is stepping away from \u201cThe NFL Today. \u201d \u201cI am stepping away from the NFL Today,\u201d he said during \u201cBoomer and Gio\u201d on Monday, per Audacy. com. \u201cI really thought the Super Bowl was my swan song. I feel like the way CBS handled us guys out there in Las Vegas, it was amazing. \u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable run for me. I feel so grateful and privileged to be there for 22 years. \u201d \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d on CBS will have a new look this fall as Matt Ryan, the 2016 NFL Most Valuable Player and a four-time Pro Bowl quarterback, now moves to the studio and joins James Brown, Nate Burleson, Bill Cowher and JJ Watt. The announcement was made Monday by David Berson, President and CEO, CBS Sports. Former USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams is finally an NFL signal caller. Williams is said to have dreamed about being in this position for a long time, and it finally came true on Thursday when the Chicago Bears selected him with the No. 1 overall pick. It's a dream come true, but the work has just started for the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner. It won't be easy, as every rookie quarterback has gone through struggles. However, Williams is confident that as long as he's himself, he will be just fine. The 22-year-old told reporters in Chicago, including Dan Wiederer of The Chicago Tribune. \"I don't think about it, to be honest with you,\" Williams said. \"I think about just doing my job, handling the things I can handle, dealing with the small things, holding everybody accountable and everybody holding me accountable. Gregory Shamus/Getty Images It remains to be seen how it will translate to the actual field, but the Arizona Cardinals, Washington Commanders and Pittsburgh Steelers can all take solace in one thing. One of the most notable people in NFL media believe they won the 2024 draft. NFL Network's discussed the draft on Monday and said the Cardinals, Commanders and Steelers all had the best drafts based on his big board: Arizona landed arguably the best player in all of college football last season in wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. with the No. 4 overall pick.

Players who have applied for early entry maintain the right to withdraw from consideration no later than 5 p. m. ET on June 16. Under NCAA rules, in order to retain college basketball eligibility, college players who have entered the draft face an earlier deadline of May 29. Seniors are listed with early-entry prospects because of the existing COVID-era eligibility rule granting players an additional season if they were enrolled during the pandemic. It's not uncommon for large numbers of players to \"test\" the draft process with plans to return. The NBA has officially released the initial list of early entrants for the 2024 NBA draft, announcing in a press release that 195 players have filed as early entry candidates. Of those prospects, 138 are from colleges, 43 had been playing for teams internationally, and 14 were playing non-college ball stateside (ie. the G League or Overtime Elite). While that early entrant total obviously far exceeds the number of players who will be selected in this year\u2019s draft (58), it\u2019s down significantly from the figures we\u2019ve seen in recent years. A record 353 early entrants initially declared for the draft in 2021, but that number dropped to 283 in 2022 and 242 a year ago. The NCAA\u2019s NIL policy, which allows college athletes to be paid based on their name, image, and likeness, has presumably been a major factor in that trend..\n\nQuestion: How many this College or university men's basketball players are on the NBA's list of early-entry candidates for the 2024 NBA Draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

Guard Trey Alexander and center Ryan Kalkbrenner are on the NBA's early entry candidates list. Alexander averaged 17. 9 points and 4. 7 assists per game while earning second-team All-Big East honors as a junior. Kalkbrenner, a three-time Big East defensive player of the year, had 17. 3 points and 6. 3 rebounds per game as a senior. Bellevue West grad Frankie Fidler, who recently transferred to Michigan State, and Millard North grad Saint Thomas are also on the list. Under NCAA rules, players who enter the NBA draft must withdraw by May 29 to retain college eligibility. Stevenson was listed as an early entrant in the NBA Draft, but is expected to still return to school. TUSCALOOSA, Ala. \u2014 Alabama freshman forward Jarin Stevenson has entered his name in the NBA Draft, per the list of early entry candidates published by NBA communications on Tuesday morning. As an early entry candidate, Stevenson maintains his college eligibility. A source tells BamaCentral that Stevenson is expected to ultimately withdraw his name from the draft and return to Alabama. Stevenson was a highly touted recruit, originally a 5-star prospect in the 2024 class before reclassifying to 2023 and joining Alabama as a 17-year old last summer. As one of the youngest players in college basketball he showed flashes throughout the season of what made him such a highly-ranked recruit, but also struggled with some of the physicality of playing in the SEC. Four players from the West Coast Conference have declared for the 2024 draft The NBA announced that 195 players have filed as early entry candidates for the 2024 NBA Draft. Among those, Michael Ajayi was the only entry from the Gonzaga Bulldogs. Ajayi, a 6-foot-7 wing from Kent, Washington, earned All-WCC first team honors this past season after averaging 17. 2 points and 9. 9 rebounds with the Pepperdine Waves. He shot 46. 7% from the field and 47. 0% from 3-point range. Shortly after he announced his transfer to Gonzaga, Ajayi entered his name into the NBA Draft while maintaining his college eligibility. Following Saturday's the early-entry deadline for this 2024 NBA Draft, the NBA on Tuesday released its pool of early entry candidates. We've been tracking the list of potential draft candidates all year long on The Draftables, a comprehensive list of prospects in contention to hear their name called this year. The list was designed to mirror the process of an NBA front office, so when it initially debuted in the fall, there is a long list of prospects that scouts were interested in. As the season arrived, and went on, that list evolved, not just by getting smaller but eventually by being sorted into various tiers. The NBA officially has announced its early-entry candidates for the 2024 draft. In accordance with Markus Burton declaring for the draft earlier this month, his name was included among the 195 on the list. However, all indications are that Burton will return to Notre Dame for his sophomore season, and he even alluded to such in his announcement. For Burton to officially retain his college eligibility, he must withdraw from draft consideration by May 29. In the meantime, he will have the opportunity to show the current makeup of his game in front of NBA scouts. He plans to use the feedback from that opportunity to better himself as a basketball player. Even if Burton somehow decides to still be a candidate at draft time, he isn\u2019t expected to be picked by anyone as no mock draft anywhere has him listed at all. Terrance Williams II will likely face his former school next season. The senior forward who played the past four seasons at Michigan, including the last two as a starter, transferred to USC on Tuesday. Williams confirmed the decision in a text to MLive. He was on the NBA\u2019s list of draft entrants released Tuesday, as he was weighing his options this offseason. He\u2019d considered returning for a fifth and final season at Michigan, but ultimately chose to head to Los Angeles. USC is joining the Big Ten next season. Eric Musselman will be in his first year as head coach after coming from Arkansas; Williams is the eighth transfer to the Trojans this offseaosn. Ajayi could still participate in the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago from May 12-19 if he receives an invite. Fifth-year senior Anton Watson wasn\u2019t listed in the early entry candidates pool because his college eligibility is exhausted, so he\u2019s already granted NBA Draft status by the league. Watson is expected to go through pre-draft workouts and potentially receive an invite to the draft combine. Around this time a year ago, the Spokane native was participating in the NBA G League draft combine before returning to Gonzaga for his fifth season.

Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner is an early entrant in the 2024 NBA Draft, the league announced Tuesday morning. Someone familiar with the situation told The World-Herald that Kalkbrenner is maintaining his final year of college eligibility, keeping the door open on a return to Omaha. His announcement marks the Jays\u2019 second program-changing decision in a little less than 96 hours. Junior guard Trey Alexander declared for the draft on Friday and isn\u2019t expected back at CU, an expectation that inched closer to reality with Saturday afternoon\u2019s addition of Texas Tech transfer Pop Isaacs. Kalkbrenner is a three-time Big East defensive player of the year, joining Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning as the only people in conference history to do that.

Both players still have the option to remove themselves from the draft process and return to school after receiving feedback from NBA teams about their stock. The 6-foot-11 Stevenson, a North Carolina native, scored 5. 3 points per game this season for the Crimson Tide. He played in all 37 games for UA, starting five. Stevenson\u2019s best moment of his first season came at the best possible time. 8 rebounds and 2. 1 assists. \"I've had a year with some ups and downs but all added to growth for me as a man, student and athlete,\" James wrote on Instagram. \"I've made the decision to enter the NBA Draft while maintaining my college eligibility, and will also be entering the NCAA transfer portal. Thank you to USC for an amazing freshman year, and as always thankful for my family, friends, doctors, athletic trainers and fans for their support. \" James missed USC's overseas trip to Greece and Croatia for a three-game summer tour and was absent from the start of fall workouts because of the cardiac arrest incident.

Messi scores two more as Miami win 4-1 at New England Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez of Inter Miami were on the scoresheet in a 4-1 win at the New England Revolution on Saturday. (Maddie Meyer) Lionel Messi continued his rich vein of scoring in MLS, finding the target twice as league leaders Inter Miami came from behind for a 4-1 win at the New England Revolution on Saturday. With his brace Messi, the top scorer in MLS, took his tally to nine goals from seven appearances this season. A crowd over 65,612 turned up at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, the stadium the Revolution share with the NFL's New England Patriots, to see the Argentine World Cup winner. FOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014 Lionel Messi scored two goals to excite a New England Revolution-record crowd, leading Inter Miami CF to a 4-1 victory on Saturday night. Messi didn\u2019t disappoint the crowd of 65,612 that filled Gillette Stadium, scoring on a left-footed kick from deep inside the box for his ninth goal of the season to break a 1-1 tie in the 68th minute. The attendance beat the previous record of 61,316, when the Revolution lost to the LA Galaxy in the 2002 MLS final. In the opening half, he was a few feet inside the box when he scored on a left-foot kick in the 33rd minute, erasing a 1-0 deficit. When the 36-year-old 2022 World Cup winner scored, loud cheers echoed around the stands in a match that featured the Eastern Conference\u2019s first-place Miami against the last-place Revolution. That\u2019s something we were aware of when we decided to bring him back, but we know that he\u2019s able to reach that maximum very quickly,\u201d Dormund coach Edin Terzic said Friday. \u201cEvery training session, Jadon has a moment that shows his incredible talent and we see how hard-working he is with the team. \u201d. A bigger-picture view Goalkeeper Andre Blake put Gazdag\u2019s achievements in perspective as the last remaining Union player who played with Le Toux. \u201cThere\u2019s been guys at teams long enough that didn\u2019t do it, so hats off to Dani,\u201d Blake said. \u201cHe\u2019s really effective, he\u2019s efficient, and he goes out there and he gets the job done. He deserves it, and hopefully he can keep going. \u201d How did Gazdag feel about the milestone? Jim Curtin predicted in his postgame news conference that the Hungarian \u201cwould give anything for the three points tonight,\u201d and the player proved his manager right. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s still annoying that we lost today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been much better if we\u2019d won the game and I\u2019d scored. It\u2019s a nice number, but it\u2019s still annoying, the game today. Sophia Smith scored twice to give the Portland Thorns a 2-0 win over the Chicago Red Stars at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Illinois. Smith now has a league-leading five goals in six games. In the 10th minute, Smith took several dribbles in the box to create just enough space to shoot, finishing into the right corner. She scored her second in the 26th minute, running onto Christine Sinclair\u2019s pass and sliding her shot into the left corner. Janine Beckie thought she gave Portland a third goal in the 79th minute when she picked off goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher\u2019s pass and finished into an open goal, but a video review confirmed the ball deflected slightly off Smith\u2019s arm. He has also contributed significantly to the transformation of Miami\u2019s fortunes, helping the team win its first trophy last August, as well as taking it to the top of the Eastern Conference standings this campaign. 3 all-time scorer isn\u2019t Przybylko (who\u2019s No. 4) or Sapong (No. 5), but Juli\u00e1n Carranza: 41 goals in 89 games over two seasons and change. \u00bb READ MORE: The Union want to expand Subaru Park, but know it won\u2019t be easy: \u2018We want to be better, bigger\u2019 Even Mikael Uhre is in the top 10, for all the criticism he gets, with 28 goals. That\u2019s tied with Jack McInerney, another blast from the past, and Bedoya. It also says something that the player who will soon stand alone at No. 1 is a midfielder, not a striker \u2014 though as Bedoya correctly pointed out Saturday night, Gazdag often gets as far forward in attacks as strikers do. Miami have won three straight games since their exit from the CONCACAF Champions Cup at the hands of Mexican club Monterrey with Messi scoring five times in that run which includes wins at Kansas City and at home to Nashville. Coach Gerardo Martino said the team were starting to come together as he had hoped. \"The Kansas City game was a key for us, because we had just been eliminated by Monterrey and the team showed their character. Now we have three wins in a row and it is getting more solid every time,\" he said. Martino said the rest of his players had now got used to playing in front of the large crowds that Messi is drawing. \"We've handled it well. That was a learning curve last season and now we are dealing with it well,\" he added..\n\nQuestion: Who scored twice and broke two Major League Soccer records in this Soccer team's win?\nAnswers:\nA.

Minnesota was knocked out of the playoffs in each of the past two seasons, including in five games against the Nuggets last season. They might get another crack at them soon. The Wolves were a handful for the Suns throughout the series, flashing a deep roster that includes veteran point guard Mike Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, defensive star Rudy Gobert, sixth man of the year Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels. But there's little doubt Edwards and Towns lead the show. Edwards had just nine points in the first half before unloading on the Suns after the break, which was enough to overcome Booker's 49 points. His powerful, one-handed jam late in the fourth sealed the win. \u201cThat was the gameplan, get everyone involved,\u201d Edwards said. Better shooting from Jamal Murray and better production from their bench put the Nuggets in good position to finish off the Lakers for the second consecutive season. 5. New York Knicks Up 3-1 vs. Philadelphia: Think of the all-time great Knicks players \u2013 Willis Reed, Earl Monroe, Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, Bernard King, Patrick Ewing, Carmelo Anthony. Until Sunday, no Knicks player had ever scored more than 46 points in a playoff game. New York guard Jalen Brunson set a Knicks playoff scoring record with 47 points in the Knicks\u2019 Game 4 victory. He also had 10 assists. At some point the Knicks will need more scoring from someone other than Brunson, but the defense is doing enough in this series. 6. Indiana Pacers Up 3-1 vs. m. ET on TNT Boston leads series 2-1  Series odds: Celtics -10000, Heat +3000 Order was restored for Boston in Game 3. The shocking home loss (a continuing trend Boston will have to correct later in the playoffs), made this more of a series than anyone anticipated, but the Celtics cruised in Miami on Saturday. Miami never led in Game 3 and was never within 15 points in the second half of a 20-point loss. So now the Celtics are an even bigger favorite in Game 4. Boston was favored by 9. 5 points in Game 3, but that has moved to double digits after Saturday\u2019s blowout win. Boston has been consistently the most favored team in the first-round series, even with that home blip in Game 2. But there\u2019s little doubt Edwards and Towns lead the show. Edwards had just nine points in the first half before unloading on the Suns after the break, which was enough to overcome Booker\u2019s 49 points. His powerful, one-handed jam late in the fourth sealed the win. \u201cThat was the gameplan, get everyone involved,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cBut in the second half, it\u2019s time to win. I\u2019ve got to shoot my shots. \u201d The Wolves have slowly improved under third-year coach Finch, who was replaced by assistant Micah Nori for the final 1:41 as the Wolves pulled away to win. Nori said Finch was in good spirits after the game and will be ready to lead the team going forward. Matthew Stockman/Getty Images The Minnesota Timberwolves finished their first-round sweep over the Phoenix Suns with a 122-116 win on Sunday, but it wasn't all good news for the victors. The Timberwolves confirmed after the game that head coach Chris Finch ruptured the patellar tendon in his right knee, according to Chris Hine of the Star Tribune. Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium initially reported that the fear was that Finch suffered a torn patellar tendon in his knee from a late-game collision with point guard Mike Conley on the sidelines. Finch was helped off the floor, and assistant coach Micah Nori finished the game in his role. \"They're evaluating him now,\" Nori told reporters after the win. \"We're not sure. Here are five takeaways from the Lakers\u2019 119-108 win against Denver in Game 4: Maybe soon but not today The Lakers staved off elimination by playing their most complete game of the playoffs in a wire-to-wire win against the Nuggets. For the fourth straight game, they led by double digits, but for the first time against Denver, they held that lead. \u201cWe knew they were going to make a couple of runs, a prideful, championship team. \u2026 We had some unfortunate fouls, some unfortunate turnovers. But we kept the scoreboard moving as well, which you have to,\u201d coach Darvin Ham said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to shut anyone down completely for the entire game so you just have to be prepared for that onslaught and make sure you\u2019re doing what you need to do and meeting force with force. Force them into tough situations. I've got to shoot my shots. \u201d The Wolves have slowly improved under third-year coach Finch, who was replaced by assistant Micah Nori for the final 1:41 as the Wolves pulled away to win. Nori said Finch was in good spirits after the game and will be ready to lead the team going forward. \u201cIt's just one series win, you don't want to overblow it, but it's the next step in the progression for all our guys,\u201d Nori said. \u201d Advertisement After disastrous second halves in the previous three games, the Lakers were only a minus-2 in the second half Saturday, withstanding every Denver push with consistent and organized offense and just enough defense. \u201cWe know. We\u2019ve talked about it,\u201d LeBron James said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about it. It\u2019s something that\u2019s been an Achilles\u2019 heel for us all season, coming into the third quarter with some energy and understanding that teams want to try to make that run when the second [half] happens. So we talked about it again tonight and we were able to fix it. And it goes with more than just talking about it. You got to go out and be about it as well. And we did that. 1 overall selection in 2020. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d Towns said before looking at Edwards. \u201cPlaying with my man on my right just makes it more special. To be able to do it with someone I have so much admiration for, so much respect for. \u201cThe future\u2019s so bright for him, I\u2019ve got to put my sunglasses on. \u201d The Suns swept the three-game, regular-season series from the Wolves, but Minnesota flipped that script in the postseason by wearing down a Phoenix team that had championship aspirations with their All-Star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal.

In other words, it resembled the other three games that the Panthers won. Tight games that could have gone either way. But as they did in their other three victories, the Panthers were the ones to make key plays at crucial times. And similar to those other three contests, the Panthers had a one-goal third-period lead and effectively locked things down defensively. Certainly, the Lightning had some frustrating calls go against them. They thought they had scored the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first goal, but Anthony Cirelli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rebound tally was erased due to Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successful goalie interference challenge. In the second period, the Lightning appeared to have tied the game at two. The Lightning had another goal waved off in the second period when Mikhail Sergachev appeared to tie it on a long-range shot from the blue line. The goal was immediately waved off because of goaltender interference by Cirelli, and upheld after a failed Tampa Bay challenge. Lightning coach Jon Cooper said he didn\u2019t feel Duclair\u2019s interference was \u201cegregious\u201d enough to warrant disallowing the goal. \u201cNow we have to rebound from that. We do, and then the next one is a net-front battle. I will give the goalie credit \u2014 He quit on the play. He completely quit. There was maybe incidental contact at most. \u201cNet-front battles aren\u2019t allowed anymore?\u201d Cooper continued. \u201cThat\u2019s part of everybody\u2019s game. The boxing out that goes there is like prison rules in the playoffs. But it\u2019s not prison rules for the goallie?. But it doesn't matter. You go out there and keep playing,\" Cirelli said. Cooper felt that Bobrovsky embellished on the play. \"I'll give the goalie credit. He completely quit on the play. Didn't see it, flailed and maybe there's incidental contact at most. But now we have to challenge it because they saw the reaction from the goaltender,\" Cooper said. \"Bob's doing the right thing. He duped them. So be it. But we have to make that challenge. \" Cooper felt the spirit of the goalie interference rule wasn't violated by either play. \"In this league, goals are at a premium. All we've done is make the rules for more goal scoring. Every year it seems like there's something that we tweak so there's more goal scoring. That's great. But there's mandates. Rodrigues added a score for good measure with less than six minutes left to play on a wrist shot that was his first goal of the playoffs, and Verhaeghe scored an empty-netter with just under four minutes to play to stretch his franchise-record goals total to 20. Mikkola added to the onslaught with another empty-netter nearly three minutes later. Anthony Cirelli appeared to have scored Tampa Bay's first goal when he tapped a loose puck past Bobrovsky with seven minutes left in the first period. The goal was overturned, however, after the Panthers challenged for goaltender interference. Former Panther Anthony Duclair's right skate made contact with Bobrovsky as he was trying to make the save. The Lightning had another goal waved off in the second period when Mikhail Sergachev appeared to tie it on a long-range shot from the blue line.

Aleksander Barkov scored short-handed for a 2-0 lead, and Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman cut the lead to 2-1. Then another Lightning goal, by Mikhail Sergachev, was called off because of interference by Cirelli. Referees immediately waved it off, and Lightning coach Jon Cooper lost his challenge. Barkov and Evan Rodrigues scored in the third period, and Verhaeghe and Niko Mikkola added empty-net goals. Verhaeghe had five goals in the series. Bobrovsky, named a Vezina Trophy finalist earlier Monday, finished with 31 saves. Another goal waived off for the #GoBolts for goaltender interference. This one is a bit more controversial. pic. twitter. TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) \u2014 The Tampa Bay Lightning were eliminated from the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Monday after falling 6-1 to the Florida Panthers, in what could have been Steven Stamkos\u2019 final game in a Lightning jersey. The Panthers won the series 4-1, with the sole Lightning win coming in Game 4 on Saturday at Amalie Arena. The Lightning put the puck in the net first, however, that goal was overturned after review due to goalie interference. The Lightning also had another goal waived off late in the 2nd Period, also due to goalie interference. Niko Mikkola had a goal and an assist, Evan Rodrigues also scored and Matthew Tkachuk had two assists for the Panthers, who won a playoff series against Tampa Bay for the first time in franchise history and clinched a postseason series at home for only the fourth time. But the teams' playoff fortunes changed last season when the Lightning were ousted in the first round by the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Panthers pulled off three consecutive upsets to reach the final. Florida this season won the Atlantic Division title, while the Lightning (whose depth has been whittled over the years as they deal with the salary cap) were the first wild-card seed. How the Panthers beat the Lightning in Game 5 The team that scored first had won every game in the series, and Anthony Cirelli's first-period goal for Tampa Bay was overturned because of goalie interference by Antony Duclair after Florida coach Paul Maurice challenged. Anthony Cirelli's goal is overturned after review. pic. twitter. \"You saw our reaction. It's just one of those. it's very frustrating,\" Duclair said. \"I always have a ref screaming in my ear. I thought I was out of the blue paint. When you look at the video, I was clearly out of there. It is what it is, it's a judgment call. \" The second goalie interference play happened at 17:48 of the second period, as a goal was immediately waved off when the officials said Cirelli made incidental contact with Bobrovsky while battling defenseman Niko Mikkola. Tampa Bay challenged the call, but it was upheld on video review. \"Obviously, it sucks. But it's our job to go out there and keep battling and trying to get the next one. The Tampa Bay Lightning saw a goal called back for goalie interference in each of the first two periods of Monday's Game 5 series-ending loss to the Florida Panthers.

The Lightning had another goal waved off in the second period when Mikhail Sergachev appeared to tie it on a long-range shot from the blue line. The goal was immediately waved off because of goaltender interference by Cirelli, and upheld after a failed Tampa Bay challenge. The Lightning's NHL-best power play during the regular season was inconsistent in this first round.

The decision was made in accordance with Rule 69. 1 which states, in part, \u2018Goals should be disallowed only if: (1) an attacking player, either by his positioning or by contact, impairs the goalkeeper\u2019s ability to move freely within his crease or defend his goal. \u2019\u201d \u2014 the NHL\u2019s official explanation of Tampa Bay\u2019s second disallowed goal (by Sergachev) \u201cMaybe this wasn\u2019t the teams we\u2019ve had in the past, but that (sentiment) didn\u2019t creep into this room. We played hard, we showed it in this series. Overturned goals doom Tampa Bay Lightning in season finale Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper was highly critical of two goalie interference calls that went against his team in its Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers, which eliminated the Lightning from the Stanley Cup playoffs on Monday night. \"This is clearly a turning point in the game. If anyone's going to talk about this game, they're going to talk about the goals that were taken away,\" Cooper said after the 6-1 loss to Florida, a score inflated by two empty-net goals by the Panthers. The first goalie interference review was a coach's challenge initiated by Florida at 13 minutes of the first period. Video review determined that Tampa Bay's Anthony Duclair impaired Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky's ability to play his position in the crease prior to Anthony Cirelli's goal. \"You saw our reaction. It's just one of those. it's very frustrating,\" Duclair said. \"I always have a ref screaming in my ear. I thought I was out of the blue paint. When you look at the video, I was clearly out of there. It is what it is, it's a judgment call. \" The second goalie interference play happened at 17:48 of the second period, as a goal was immediately waved off when the officials said Cirelli made incidental contact with Bobrovsky while battling defenseman Niko Mikkola. Tampa Bay challenged the call, but it was upheld on video review. \"Obviously, it sucks. But it's our job to go out there and keep battling and trying to get the next one. Rodrigues added a score for good measure with less than six minutes left to play on a wrist shot that was his first goal of the playoffs, and Verhaeghe scored an empty-netter with just under four minutes to play to stretch his franchise-record goals total to 20. Mikkola added to the onslaught with another empty-netter nearly three minutes later. Anthony Cirelli appeared to have scored Tampa Bay's first goal when he tapped a loose puck past Bobrovsky with seven minutes left in the first period. The goal was overturned, however, after the Panthers challenged for goaltender interference. Former Panther Anthony Duclair's right skate made contact with Bobrovsky as he was trying to make the save. The Lightning had another goal waved off in the second period when Mikhail Sergachev appeared to tie it on a long-range shot from the blue line. The Tampa Bay Lightning saw a goal called back for goalie interference in each of the first two periods of Monday's Game 5 series-ending loss to the Florida Panthers. First, Anthony Cirelli's would-be opener was wiped off the board after Panthers head coach Paul Maurice successfully challenged the goal. After review, the goal comes off the board. pic. twitter. com/NXgmloWqKd \u2014 Bally Sports Sun: Lightning (@BallyLightning) April 29, 2024 Then, late in the second period, the Bolts appeared to tie the game at 2-2 on a point blast from Mikhail Sergachev.

And when we needed them, we couldn\u2019t (convert), and they get the timely kills and the one timely power-play goal (in Game 1). \u201d By the numbers 2: Successful challenges (in as many attempts) of would-be Lightning goals in this series by Panthers coach Paul Maurice.

The decision was made in accordance with Rule 69. pic. twitter. com/SGHdp4aaKM \u2014 Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) April 30, 2024 Anthony Cirelli\u2019s mood was at a boiling point late in the second period when he cruelly became part of a second Lightning goal being wiped off the board. With 2:12 left in the second period, Mikhail Sergachev thought he had completed a comeback from 2-0 down with a tying goal. But referee Eric Furlatt immediately waved off the goal, asserting that Cirelli was in the crease and knocked Bobrovsky\u2019s stick out of his grasp. Coach Jon Cooper challenged, but the NHL Situation Room in Toronto upheld the call and Florida got a power play. Advertisement What made this especially hard on Cirelli was that the Lightning thought they jumped out to a 1-0 first-period lead when Cirelli found Dumba\u2019s rebound, skating himself into open space and burying the puck into an open net. Barkov registered his 11th career multi-point playoff game. He is Florida\u2019s all-time leader with 52 playoff games, 29 assists and 42 points. He had 16 points during the Panthers\u2019 run to the 2023 Stanley Cup Final. Hedman scored the lone goal for the Lightning, who had two goals wiped out due to goalie interference. Teams that hold a 3-1 lead in a best-of-seven series are now 307-32 all-time. The Panthers have won eight of their past 10 playoff games at home, including all three in this series. They will face the winner of the Bruins\u2013Maple Leafs series, which Boston leads 3-1.

The final score was an ugly one, but Game Five was a close contest until the Panthers pulled away late in the third. In other words, it resembled the other three games that the Panthers won. Tight games that could have gone either way. But as they did in their other three victories, the Panthers were the ones to make key plays at crucial times. And similar to those other three contests, the Panthers had a one-goal third-period lead and effectively locked things down defensively. Certainly, the Lightning had some frustrating calls go against them. They thought they had scored the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first goal, but Anthony Cirelli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rebound tally was erased due to Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successful goalie interference challenge.

Williams covers UCLA football (@JHWreporter) April 27, 2024 Wide receiver Titus Mokiao-Atimalala had an impressive showing, catching every pass that came his way from the UCLA quarterbacks.

' UCLA's DeShaun Foster details plans With UCLA holding its first Bruin Walk since the end of the Jim Mora era and staging its first spring showcase at the Rose Bowl since 2015, it was fun to be a Bruin again. \u201cCoach Foster has L. A. behind us again,\u201d defensive lineman Jay Toia said, \u201cso it feels great. \u201d A crowd of 11,703 that dwarfed previous turnouts for the spring showcase at Drake Stadium saw the UCLA offense defeat the defense 43-31 in a reversal of fortunes given the defense\u2019s dominance during much of spring practices. \u201cIt was easier for them to score points in my score system,\u201d Foster said with a laugh of the offense, \u201cbut the defense did a great job all spring. DEKALB, Ill. (WTVO/WQRF) \u2014 The Northern Illinois University football team capped off spring practices Saturday before several hundred fans with its \u201cSpring Showcase\u201d event. The vast majority of the two-hour session was 11-on-11 work featuring the first unit offense against the number one defense, and so on. It was a great opportunity for head coach Thomas Hammock and his assistants to see the Huskies\u2019 quarterbacks in game-type situations. The starting quarterback job is wide open going into next season. The top three candidates appear to be returning redshirt junior Ethan Hampton, redshirt junior Jalen Macon who transferred in from Arkansas-Pine Bluff, and redshirt freshman Josh Holst from Marengo High School. Holst put together one long touchdown drive capped off by two terrific catches by Andrew McElroy. The second one was a touchdown catch at the back of the endzone. On a less than ideal spring day, the Northern Colorado football team defense had its way with the Bears\u2019 offense and won the day during an intrasquad game Saturday afternoon at Nottingham Field. The rainy, damp and raw afternoon posed a legitimate challenge for the offense through much of the 90-minute Blue and Gold Spring Showcase game marking the end of the team\u2019s month-long spring practice season. Wearing navy jerseys, the UNC defense made plenty of stops, snagged two interceptions and blocked a late field attempt in the 13-6 victory. Playing on a 50-yard field for each drive, the squads received one point each for a touchdown or field goal, one point for stopping the offense and one point for advancing to the 50 when drives began at the 25. \"Been very, very fast,\" Tatum said of the new install. \"Just getting used to new faces, learning names and once we got through that part just learning a whole new system. It went very well. It's still going on because we're still learning, still getting better as a team and coming together. \"  Michigan State's offense got the better of its defense in the Spring Showcase scrimmage with a 31-24 victory. Still, Tatum liked the mindset that his defensive teammates played with. \"I think today showed a lot of, you know, being able to move on to the next play and keep playing as a team,\" the junior said. Tatum later expanded on the biggest areas of improvement he's saw on both sides of the ball during spring. Foster is endearing himself to the fan base quite well. Things are different in Westwood nowadays. When athletic director Martin Jarmond opted to hire DeShaun Foster as the UCLA Bruins football coach, more than a few eyebrows were raised. Foster had no head coaching experience prior to landing the gig. The thought of reversing the fortunes of this program was also daunting. Objectively speaking, Chip Kelly cratered the program -- and robbed any joy it once had. Suffice it to say, but Foster has his work cut out for himself. On Saturday, UCLA held its Spring Showcase. The team was having somewhat of a scripted game out at the Rose Bowl with reportedly close to 20,000 in attendance. Lunch was served inside one of the major donor tents.

(Meg Oliphant / Los Angeles Times) A few hours before UCLA players dragged each other to the ground as part of a one-on-one competition and linemen thudded viciously into one another, there were fist bumps and hugs in the revival of a grand Bruins tradition. Wearing white sweatpants and hoodies adorned with a Bruins logo on the chest, players disembarked from a bus at the Rose Bowl and walked between roped-off lines of family and friends, some cheering and others holding up cellphones to document the moment. It was a daylong celebration featuring notable alumni including Chicago Bulls All-Star guard Zach LaVine and football luminaries Wendell Tyler, Gaston Green, Zach Charbonnet and Laiatu Latu, who was recently selected No. 15 in the NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts. The spring showcase concluded a whirlwind week for Toia, who withdrew from the transfer portal on Monday \u2014 later joking it was a \u201cfour-day vacation\u201d \u2014 and attended the draft Thursday to support Latu alongside Foster and defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe.

(WFLA) \u2014 The Tampa Bay Lightning were eliminated from the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Monday after falling 6-1 to the Florida Panthers, in what could have been Steven Stamkos\u2019 final game in a Lightning jersey. The Panthers won the series 4-1, with the sole Lightning win coming in Game 4 on Saturday at Amalie Arena. The Lightning put the puck in the net first, however, that goal was overturned after review due to goalie interference. The Lightning also had another goal waived off late in the 2nd Period, also due to goalie interference. Niko Mikkola had a goal and an assist, Evan Rodrigues also scored and Matthew Tkachuk had two assists for the Panthers, who won a playoff series against Tampa Bay for the first time in franchise history and clinched a postseason series at home for only the fourth time. Or did they? Sure, no team wants to fall so far behind in a series that they leave themselves no room for error. But then, no team has been better in those situations over the years than the Lightning, either. Well, OK, one. But the Seattle Kraken have only played in three elimination games (all in 2023), winning two. Of teams that have a postseason history longer than a year, the Lightning are tied with the Islanders for the best winning percentage in the NHL when facing playoff elimination (57. 1), winning 16 of 28 games. They picked up their 16th in Saturday\u2019s 6-3 victory in Game 4. They\u2019ll need to tack on three more wins to avoid being knocked out of the playoffs in the opening round for a second straight season.

Barkov added a second goal with 8:56 left in regulation, Evan Rodrigues made it 4-1 three minutes later and Verhaeghe and Niko Mikkola added empty-netters. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 31 shots. Florida won the first three games of the series before dropping Game 4 to extend the series one more game. Next up for Florida will be the winner of the series between the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs. Boston leads that series 3-1 entering Game 5 on Tuesday.

The Panthers gave up just one goal during 5-on-5 play, with two coming when both teams had a player in the penalty box. Stamkos, Hagel and Point scored 6:13 apart in the first to make it 3-0. Stamkos scored on a power play, while Hagel had a short-handed goal. \u201cWe were a little bit slow,\u201d Florida coach Paul Maurice told the AP.

Nadal hasn\u2019t decided when he plans to hang up his racquet this season but the former world number one\u2019s retirement is fast approaching. In a tightly contested match, Lehecka surged ahead after ten games, breaking Nadal's serve and clinching the first set. Nadal struggled to recover, conceding the second set, bidding adieu to the tournament's most decorated champion. A poignant ceremony followed, honoring Nadal's legacy on the Manolo Santana Stadium. Banners bearing \"Gracias Rafa\" adorned the stands, acknowledging his triumphs over the years. In response, Nadal, amidst his family's presence, quipped, \"This was a joke, because I'll be back next year. All I can say is thank you to everyone that has helped me in my career.

For Nadal, the Madrid Open serves as a great indicator about his level. He came into the event wanting to play just one match, and he got to play four, experiencing different conditions and playing against different opponents.

Michigan football offensive lineman Trevor Keegan has been selected by the Philadelphia Eagles with the No. 172 overall pick in the fifth round of the 2024 NFL draft. Keegan, a 6-foot-5, 310-pound left guard, became one of the key figures during the Wolverines' remarkable run that unfolded over the last three seasons when they won 40 of 43 games, three consecutive Big Ten titles and the national championship this past January. He remembers being down in the dumps four years ago, uncertain of what the future had in store for him. He played all of 53 offensive snaps during his first two seasons with Michigan, and the Wolverines, like him, seemed to be headed nowhere fast after they bottomed out with a 2-4 record during the dismal fall of 2020. \u201cI was kind of in the same state of the program,\u201d he said. With one of their seventh-round picks in the 2024 NFL draft, the Tennessee Titans selected safety James Williams out of Miami. While he played safety in college, the 6-foot-4, 231-pound prospect started working at linebacker down at the Senior Bowl in February \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly where the Titans plan on playing him in the NFL. \u201cIt is a good adjustment,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI have to do some learning, have to start over from square one, like I have to learn football all over again. But I am ready for it, embracing it, and ready to put my talents on display. I\u2019ll try to do everything I can do to make this team great. 0 AVG), 6 TD NOTES \u2014 Born April 7, 2000 \u2014 3-star recruit in BYU's 2018 class, per 247Sports \u2014 Transferred from BYU to Colorado State in 2023 \u2014 16 career starts \u2014 Spent 2019 and 2020 on mission in Vina del Mar, Chile \u2014 Missed a majority of the 2022 season with an ankle injury OVERALL Dallin Holker checks a lot of the boxes to be a useful TE2 with blocking skills and yards-after-the-catch ability. Holker's selling point is his ease of movement. He is a smooth, controlled athlete who has zero issues navigating through the second and third levels. He has enough speed to run away from linebackers and the agility to beat safeties on deeper routes such as seam benders and sail routes. Those same movement skills show up when Holker has the ball. He is a graceful and confident runner. with the 155th overall pick. Trotter Jr. is a South Jersey native who played high school at St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philly and is the son of Eagles Hall of Fame linebacker Jeremiah Trotter. While playing at Clemson University, Trotter Jr. led the Tigers this past season with 87 tackles, 14. 5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and two interceptions. Trotter's father is longtime NFL linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, who played 11 seasons in the pros with Philadelphia, Washington and Tampa from 1998-2009. Trotter Jr. was a Second Team All-American a year ago. Next, the Birds traded pick 171 to the New York Jets for picks 185 and 190. The Eagles then drafted guard Trevor Keegan out of the University of Michigan with the 172nd overall pick. Will Shipley's highlights, strengths, weaknesses at Clemson football Shipley rushed for a career-high 172 rushing yards and scored two touchdowns against Syracuse on Oct. 22. 2022. Three weeks later vs. Louisville, he had a highlight-reel 25-yard touchdown in the third quarter, leaping over a defender and bouncing off two more to score his 12th touchdown of the season. Shipley's value is in his versatility: He can play running back, receiver and on special teams as a kick returner. Some of his weaknesses include lack of strength and power, which are needed as a ball carrier and pass blocker in the NFL. Eagles 3rd-round pick Jalyx Hunt is diamond in the rough for Eagles When you\u2019re projecting an edge rusher, pay less attention to the stats and keep a close eye on how often they win and the ways that they win. Houston Christian's Jalyx Hunt fits into that latter category, finishing 2023 with 46 tackles (nine for loss) and 6\u00bd sacks, but had an eye-popping 18. 9% pass rush win rate, per Pro Football Focus. When the ball is snapped, Hunt gets hip to hip with the offensive tackle in a hurry. Because he can threaten the edge with his explosiveness and bendy limbs to turn the corner, it opens up his ability to use speed-to-power conversions. Round 5 \u2014 155th overall: Jeremiah Trotter Jr. , LB, Clemson Trotter Jr. was projected as a late Day 2 or early Day 3 pick coming into the draft. Despite finishing with great college production, some pundits are worried his size (6-0, 228 pounds) and lack of elite speed could cause him to struggle. He might be able to overcome those issues because he has good instincts. The Eagles gave the Indianapolis Colts their sixth-round pick (No. 201) to move up nine spots for him.

Like, really liked him. The Eagles traded picks No. 50, No. 53, and No. 161 to the Washington Commanders in exchange for picks that landed them DeJean. The 6-foot, 203-pound DeJean, who had seven interceptions in two seasons at Iowa, was considered a first-rounder by the Eagles. It was one reason they were willing to trade the picks to move up for their shot at drafting him. The Eagles weren\u2019t alone in the assessment of DeJean \u2014 he even thought he should have been a first-rounder. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a little frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cbut I\u2019m excited with where I\u2019m at, being in Philadelphia, being able to play for a great organization. \u201d Lurie told Roseman it was \u201crare for us to be picking in the 20s and to get two first-round players..\n\nQuestion: Who did this NFL team select with the 172nd pick in the NFL draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

Keegan started 37 games at left guard at Michigan and was voted to the All-Big Ten team three times. Keegan was also voted a captain while at Michigan. Philadelphia\u2018s interior offensive line is built around two massive guards with a smaller, mobile center who can pull into space in the run game. The Eagles had the luxury of having a potential Hall of Fame center Jason Kelce anchor their unit, but replacement Cam Jurgens is built in a similar mold. The guards, however, are behemoths. Landon Dickerson is currently listed as the starter on the left side and stands 6 feet, 6 inches and 332 pounds. The right guard, Tyler Steen, isn\u2019t much smaller. He clocks in at 6-foot-6, 321 pounds. Round 5 \u2014 155th overall: Jeremiah Trotter Jr. , LB, Clemson Trotter Jr. was projected as a late Day 2 or early Day 3 pick coming into the draft.

The Eagles needed a backup guard after losing Sua Opeta in free agency. Combined with his strength, that helps him fight back against pressure and avoid getting washed inside. However, Randolph blends in more than he stands out. He doesn't make a ton of impact plays, as he went from 13 tackles for loss in 2022 to only four this past season. That's partially due to a lack of agility to make tackles outside of his gap. He's more of a space-eater than someone who is going to wreak havoc in the backfield. As a pass-rusher, the Illinois product is limited due to a poor get-off that reduces the effectiveness of his bull rush and subpar movement skills. He has a decent arm-over move that allows him to take advantage of offensive linemen who have bad technique, but he lacks a go-to move that he'll be able to win with in the NFL.

Williams will have to earn his spot on the roster in training camp, and he\u2019ll have a role on special teams if he does. Whatever the case may be, Williams is just happy to be in Nashville. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cOnly God can control where I went, and it so happened He chose for me to be in Nashville. I am glad to bring my talents to where He wants me to be. \u201d. Holker does needs a bit of a runway to get started, though, which is why flat routes and shallow crossers are his trademark. Holker is largely limited to that style of play. He does not have an impressive catch radius or reliable hands. Holker too often fights the ball even in routine instances, and he doesn't have the concentration or quick hands to reliably snap to throws outside his frame. As a blocker, Holker is more than good enough. He is not a bully, but his movement skills allow him always to get to the spot first. Holker also plays with good intensity and sticks on blocks. Holker is likely close to his ceiling given his age and experience. His limited catch radius may also hurt his chances to emerge as a bonafide NFL starter. Guerendo had 582 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 99 carries at Wisconsin, then earned the No. 2 running back job with the Cardinals and posted career-highs in rushing yards (810), rushing touchdowns (11) and carries (132). He was originally recruited as a receiver and his catching abilities are a significant piece of his appeal at the next level. He had 358 receiving yards and a score on 22 career catches in college.

Ivi\u0161i\u0107, who has three years of eligibility remaining, missed 15 games last season but still averaged 5. 5 points, 3. 3 rebounds and 1. 3 blocks per game. In his debut game against Georgia, he scored 13 points in 16 minutes, drained a trio of 3-pointers, and led the team with three blocks and five rebounds. Before coming to Kentucky, Ivi\u0161i\u0107 played in the FIBA U20 European Championship for his home country of Croatia. He also played for two seasons in the Adriatic League for Montenegro's professional basketball club. The four-star forward out of Overtime Elite committed to Arkansas on Monday, and it was no surprise to anyone. Knox, a top-20 recruit in the 2024 class, was previously committed to Calipari at Kentucky.

Scientists uncovered 150 bones of the extinct kangaroo species in Nightshade Cave near Buchan. The skeleton has 71 per cent of its bones, which makes it the most complete fossil skeleton ever discovered in a Victorian cave. \"Most of the [bones] that are missing are very small elements, like knuckles from the hands, and small bones in the feet,\" Mr Ziegler said. The short-faced kangaroo specimen found by the researchers is a juvenile, but it may have weighed as much as 80 kilograms. An adult of the ancient species would have been about the size of a large grey or red kangaroo today, but would weigh twice as much. Researchers have suggested that this heavier structure might mean that S. occidentalis and other species of short-faced kangaroos may not have hopped, and instead walked in a similar way to humans. Gavin Prideaux, the director of palaeontology at Flinders University, says the discovery highlights that \u201cpeople who are caving and exploring new passages can sometimes make really amazing discoveries\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a really, really, good find \u2026 it gives us more information about [the extinct animals\u2019] anatomy, biology, what ecological role they played and how they moved. \u201d The short-faced kangaroo was affected by a major extinction event that wiped out 85% of large-bodied mammals, reptiles and birds. Ziegler says constant cooling and drying of the environment, habitat loss, disease, and human practices such as increased fires may have been factors that drove them to extinction. He notes that powerful, short-faced kangaroos were once among the continent\u2019s most widespread and successful marsupials. \u201cTheir abrupt extinction alongside nearly all of Australia\u2019s megafauna is a profound reminder to defend our modern environments against loss. \u201d.

The juvenile\u2019s skull was the same size as an adult human. Its shoulders had a \u201cgreat deal of flexibility\u201d, similar to humans and chimpanzees, Ziegler says. It\u2019s also believed they walked rather than hopped. \u201cThe short-faced kangaroos illustrate a whole other way of living among Australian marsupials that is unlike anything today. \u201d Short-faced kangaroos were roughly the same height as modern kangaroos but they were much heavier. Scientists estimated the weight of the juvenile kangaroo to be more than 80kg \u2013 the weight of a fully grown male red kangaroo. The first species of Protemnodon were described in 1874 by British paleontologist Owen who followed the common approach of the time, to focus chiefly on fossil teeth. He saw slight differences between the teeth of his specimens, and described six species of Protemnodon. Successive studies have whittled away at some of these early descriptions, however, the new Flinders University study agrees with one of his species, Protemnodon anak. This first specimen described, called the holotype, still resides in the Natural History Museum in London. Dr Kerr says it previously was suggested that some or all Protemnodon were quadrupedal. \u201cHowever, our study suggests that this is true of only three or four species of Protemnodon, which may have moved something like a quokka or potoroo \u2013 that is bounding on four legs at times, and hopping on two legs at others.

Here, the river valley is peppered with shadowy entrances to underground caves. Portals barely large enough to permit a willing caver open into kilometres of subterranean passages encrusted with delicate crystals twinkling in torchlight. In one of them, Nightshade Cave, the Museums Victoria Research Institute led a team of recreational cavers and Parks Victoria rangers to excavate an extraordinary fossil: a near-complete skeleton of the extinct short-faced kangaroo Simosthenurus occidentalis. A large but thick-boned and robust kangaroo, it was probably fairly slow-moving and inefficient. It may have hopped only rarely, perhaps just when startled. \u201d Dr Kerr says the best fossils of this species come from Green Waterhole Cave in southeastern South Australia, on the land of the Boandik people. The species name, mamkurra, was chosen by Boandik elders and language experts in the Burrandies Corporation. It means \u2018great kangaroo\u2019. It\u2019s unusual to have a single genus of kangaroo live in such varied environments, he says. \u201cFor example, the different species of Protemnodon are now known to have inhabited a broad range of habitats, from arid central Australia into the high-rainfall, forested mountains of Tasmania and New Guinea. \u201d The third of the new species, Protemnodon dawsonae, is known from fewer fossils than the other two, and is more of a mystery. This means that usually one ancient animal was not the source of all the bones in a full skeleton. Instead, multiple fossils are brought together to design one creature. This is fine for public display, but it's not as useful for scientists, who may need to investigate how certain bones change over time or location. An artistic depiction of S. occidentalis.

An apparent retaliatory Israeli strike on Iran followed. Although the tit-for-tat cycle appears to have ended for now, deep concerns remain that Iran or its proxies in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria or Yemen could act in such a way as to provoke a greater response from Israel or that Israel might take action that Iran feels it must retaliate for. Advertisement. April 30, 2024 TEHRAN \u2014 Iran's armed forces carried out a series of naval drills on Monday, in what officials said was a show of \"power and preparedness\" in safeguarding the Persian Gulf waters. Dubbed the \"Parade of Authority,\" the exercise marked Persian Gulf National Day and involved the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the regular army and the national police, as their units came together in the strategic Khor Musa channel, near the southwestern energy-rich port city of Mahshahr. During inauguration speeches aired by the national broadcaster, commanders and local officials referenced Iran's mid-April attack on Israel, in which the IRGC launched over 300 drones and missiles in retaliation for an Israel-blamed strike that killed seven senior officers inside the Iranian Consulate in Damascus earlier in the month. The reports of a thinning of the Iranian presence, notably around Daraa and Quneitra close to the Golan Heights, follow the suspected April 1 Israeli attack in Damascus on what Iran said was a diplomatic compound that was therefore protected by the Vienna Convention. Iran\u2019s top military official in Syria, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, was killed in the attack along with two other senior commanders and four other personnel, prompting Iran to attack Israel directly for the first time with multiple missiles and drones. While the move was calculated to avoid casualties and a Bedouin girl was the only person injured, it sent a clear message that Iran had the will and capacity to strike the Jewish state..\n\nQuestion: What attack prompted Iran to retaliate against this Country directly?\nAnswers:\nA.

The Alabama Crimson Tide are not yet finished with the 2024 recruiting class. The Tide added one more high-level player to a class that already featured three of the best recruits in the country. Get our free mobile app Labaron Philon, a top-35 recruit in the 2024 recruiting class, was previously signed with Bill Self and the Kansas Jayhawks. Philon is from Mobile, originally playing high school basketball at Baker High School. He now plays at Link Academy in Branson, Missouri. Philon asked to be released from his letter of intent to the Jayhawks in early April. Alabama was expected to be heavily involved in the re-recruitment of Philon, and Crimson Tide fans did not have to wait long for an update. The Alabama Crimson Tide men\u2019s basketball program continues to add firepower to its roster. On Sunday afternoon, 2024 four-star point guard Labaron Philon announced that he was committed to Alabama. Philon originally signed with Kansas coming out of high school. However, a series of roster moves and other factors led to Philon requesting a release from his National Letter of Intent. Philon will be the second guard to commit to Alabama this month joining Auburn Tigers transfer guard Aden Holloway. Interestingly enough, Philon was committed to the Tigers before flipping his commitment to Kansas. Now, the Alabama native will be heading to Tuscaloosa to play for the Crimson Tide. He concluded his career at Link Academy in Branson, Missouri. He was formerly at Baker High School in Mobile, Alabama. Alabama basketball has landed another guard. Labaron Philon has committed to the Crimson Tide and Nate Oats after originally signing his national letter of intent with Kansas, according to On3. com. Philon requested a release from his NLI with the Jayhawks in late April. The 247Sports composite lists him as the No. 33 overall player and the No. 3 point guard in the 2024 class. He's a 6-foot-4, 177-pound guard who played for Link Academy in Branson, Missouri. Philon is originally from Mobile, Alabama, and he played for Baker High School where he won Mr. Basketball. Then he transferred to Link Academy for his senior season. He was originally committed to Auburn before he decommitted about a year ago. Alabama was among his offers before he chose Kansas and signed his NLI. While Philon technically doesn\u2019t count as a transfer, he\u2019s an offseason pickup that reshapes how the 2024 roster can be viewed. Should Mark Sears and Grant Nelson come back and not go pro \u2014 an expectation but not a certainty considering how last year went with Charles Bediako and Jahvon Quinerly \u2014 Oats and co. will have one of the deepest rosters in the country. Philon was an offensive force in Alabama. Coaches couldn\u2019t scheme ways to stop him during his junior season (35 points per game). MaxPreps and Gatorade both named Philon the state\u2019s player of the year. He can attack the paint and shoot the 3-pointer, making it hard not to imagine him developing with Holloway in Oats\u2019 system. The Tide could return a starting backcourt with Sears and Latrell Wrightsell, offering both underclassmen cover. Philon joins Derrion Reid, Aiden Sherrell and Naas Cunningham as top 50 prospects from the 2024 class. There\u2019s a good amount of familiarity between them already, Reid and Sherrell were high school teammates at Prolific Prep (Calif. ), and Reid and Philon were EYBL teammates on Team Thad. This elite collection of high school talent is yet another sign that Oats\u2019 system is one of the most attractive in the country, and Alabama now has a Final Four berth to sell as well. Elsewhere on the roster, there\u2019s the decision of forward Grant Nelson, who hasn\u2019t made a formal announcement about entering the draft or staying at Alabama; the deadline was Saturday at midnight. The official list of draft participants will be released Monday. Required reading (Photo: Gary Cosby Jr. / USA Today). Mark Sears can return for one more season, but he declared for the NBA Draft while maintaining his college eligibility. So whether he will be on the roster in 2024-25 remains to be seen.

The University of Utah and its campus police did submit reports in December to prosecutors for criminal charges to be filed against eight students. The school said those students disrupted an event critical of the transgender community being held by a conservative club on campus, forcing officers to shut it down. But the students have contended that the charges were retribution for a previous Palestine rally earlier in the fall; the U. has said that\u2019s not the case.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) New Patriots quarterback Drake Maye Jones appeared on WEEI\u2019s \u201cJones & Mego\u201d show on Monday, touching on a variety of topics including his chances of being a Day 1 starter, his new teammates, and much more. Here are a few highlights from Maye\u2019s extended radio interview: A starting spot out of the gate? Jerod Mayo stressed on WEEI Monday morning that the \u201cbest player will play\u201d when it comes to who gets the ball at quarterback for Week 1 of the 2024 season. Some of the students facing misdemeanor charges spoke at the event. After the speeches, a few students rushed onto the grass with tents, and they popped up the poles. Students circled around, linking arms and chanting. They held hands and posters. They played hacky sack on the lawn. Inside their circle, they had first-aid kits, granola bars and megaphones. Backpacks were scattered on the surrounding sidewalks, next to signs that said, \u201cBombs made in Utah are killing kids in Gaza\u201d and \u201cCut ties to Israel. \u201d Students waved small and large Palestinian flags as they chanted: \u201cGaza, Gaza you will rise.

Authorities stated that Jones was found with \u201cobvious signs of gunshot trauma\u201d outside of a residence.

A teenage girl and adult male were also treated for non-life-threatening \u201cgunshot trauma,\u201d police added. \u201cDetails are extremely limited at this time, and investigators are actively working on what led up to the shooting,\u201d Tucson Police stated a press release late Sunday afternoon. \u201cThey believe there was a large gathering at the residence before the shooting took place, and several witnesses left the area prior to police arriving. Investigators believe that several University of Arizona students were among those attending the large gathering.

There can be no justification for the presence of these tools of violence on our campus. \u201d.

The victim, identified as 20-year-old Erin Jones, was transported to a local hospital where she passed away. Jones grew up in Newport Beach and attended Corona Del Mar High School.

Munguia is a good fighter, but his ring IQ is quite low, and he\u2019s not shown improvement in that area because of the abysmal opposition that his promoters at Golden Boy and Zanfer have been matching him against. They\u2019ve built his 11-year career for this moment for this money fight against Canelo, so they\u2019ve not shown interest in stepping Munguia against fighters that would have given him a chance to improve the way other fighters do. It\u2019s like an NFL team playing only against 4-12 teams so they can get to the Super Bowl. That\u2019s how Munguia\u2019s career has been brought along, and Canelo has accommodated him by giving him that shot. \u201cI\u2019m getting a funny feeling that Jaime Munguia might be able to pull this off.

For starters, it would allow Munguia to pressure Alvarez behind punch variety, not to mention it\u2019d prevent the undisputed super middleweight champion from banging the body \u2014 something that Munguia needs to desperately avoid. Turn the volume up with combinations Once Munguia can assert his jab from the outside within an established distance, he can look to piece together combinations by turning his punch volume way up. Doing so could go long ways toward frustrating an older Alvarez as Dmitry Bivol did en route to a unanimous decision over the boxing legend back in May 2022. Connecting on unrelenting combinations, using his angles and power, would be a driving force if Munguia has his hand raised by the end of the night.

Canelo\u2019s Decline a Key Factor \u201cThree reasons on why you should tune into Canelo-Munguia: All action, two Mexicans inside a ring at this elite level, and the passing of the torch. Jaime Munguia will beat him,\u201d said promoter Oscar De La Hoya to DAZN Boxing about this Saturday\u2019s fight between Canelo Alvarez and Jaime Munguia in Las Vegas. \u201cCanelo chose my fighter, Jaime Munguia, to fight on the Cinco De Mayo weekend. He\u2019s a beast. I think it\u2019s the changing of the guard,\u201d said De La Hoya to the Breakfast Club 105. 1 FM. \u201cCanelo is a great fighter, don\u2019t get me wrong. He fought everybody, but every fighter has their decline. Every fighter has their wear & tear. Every time there is talk about the possibility of seeing a fight between Canelo Alvarez and David Benavidez, it is said that the Mexican fighter's legacy is assured and that he has no good reason to expose his world titles to a fighter who could get him in trouble. And it is true that, throughout his 15 years as a professional boxer, the tapat\u00edo has faced in the ring the toughest opponents he could have faced in his category, coming out victorious most of the times, and he has a sure ticket to immortality in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Oscar de la Hoya assures that he would easily beat 'Canelo' Alvarez when he was in his best moment TikTok Despite a career full of successes and convincing performances in the ring, Canelo is not exempt from criticism, especially when he has been avoiding Benavidez. It was down to the last round, pretty much, and Munguia done it for me. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity. Obviously there\u2019s a bit of needle there with De La Hoya and Canelo, so that might be the more interesting sell on the fight week. Munguia\u2019s a willing participant. He done a number on me; he truly deserves his crack. \u201cI think Canelo wins. I think it\u2019ll be close. Munguia will get off to a good start \u2013 might even go three, four rounds up, maybe. But I think Canelo will come on strong the second half of the fight and make it his own. He\u2019s too accurate and he\u2019s got the lasting effect in his shots. He\u2019ll grind Munguia down, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll stop him, but I think he\u2019ll beat him on points. Oscar De La Hoya has predicted a \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d when on Saturday Jaime Munguia challenges Saul Alvarez for the undisputed super-middleweight title. \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez enters the all-Mexican showdown, at Las Vegas\u2019 T-Mobile Arena on Cinco de Mayo weekend, as the significant favourite against Munguia \u2013 a proven fighter but one who, unlike David Benavidez, is far from considered Alvarez\u2019s greatest threat. Saturday\u2019s fight comes with Munguia established as one of Golden Boy Promotions\u2019 leading fighters and with tension persisting between Alvarez and De La Hoya, Golden Boy\u2019s figurehead and therefore influential in Alvarez\u2019s success until his departure for Matchroom in 2018. Even if Munguia does win, he\u2019s not likely to hold onto his titles for long. If David Benavidez or David Morrell don\u2019t get to him, Terence Crawford probably will. He\u2019ll spot a weak champion and shoot up to 168 to end Munguia\u2019s 15 minutes of fame. De La Hoya Wants Canelo Beaten, Predicts Munguia Victory \u201cWould I encourage him to retire? Not until he fights Munguia. I want him to kick his [Canelo] a**. I think so,\u201d said De La Hoya when asked if he believes Munguia will beat Canelo. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior, but you know how it is. In boxing, the next young guy has to come up and dethrone [the champion] just like me and [Julio Cesar] Chavez back in the day. Yeah, so it has to happen. \u201d. John Ryder expects Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez to have to come from behind to win Saturday\u2019s fight against Jaime Munguia. The 33-year-old Alvarez will defend his undisputed super middleweight title against his fellow Mexican on Cinco de Mayo weekend at Las Vegas\u2019 T-Mobile Arena, in what Munguia\u2019s co-promoter Oscar De La Hoya has already promised will prove a \u201cchanging of the guard. \u201d Alvarez \u2013 also once promoted by De La Hoya and Golden Boy Promotions \u2013 remains the significant favorite as he enters what could yet be one of the final fights of his decorated career, and Ryder, one of his most recent opponents, recognizes not only the appeal that exists in a fight between them but the threat that Munguia can pose. He had a tough fight in his last outing against [John Ryder], and Munguia knocked that guy out in his last fight. \u201d Munguia definitely has the tools to defeat Canelo, but he\u2019s going to have to take big shots and put in a good enough performance to convince the judges to give him the decision if it goes to the cards. \u201cI think Munguia being 27 years old and Canelo being 34 and on his way out, I think it\u2019s the changing of the guard. Yeah,\u201d said De La Hoya when asked if he would still say Canelo was on the decline if he were still promoting him. \u201d Munguia looked beatable in his last two fights against John Ryder and Sergiy Derevyanchenko. Golden Boy boss Oscar De La Hoya predicts an upset victory with undisputed super middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez losing his four titles to Jaime Munguia this Saturday night in their headliner. De La Hoya is once again predicting a \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d moment for his fighter Munguia (43-0, 34 KOs), with him defeating the worn-out, aging lion 34-year-old Canelo (60-2-2, 39 KOs), who he reveals has had surgeries on both knees and shoulder. The way Oscar describes Canelo, he sounds like he\u2019s a fossilized artifact ready to be put in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History among the dinosaur exhibit. If Munguia can seize the mantle from aging Canelo, it would put a big smile on De La Hoya\u2019s face because that would make a star out of the 27-year-old Munguia..\n\nQuestion: Who did Oscar De La Hoya predict would beat this Boxer in the upcoming fight?\nAnswers:\nA.

It was down to the last round, pretty much, and Munguia done it for me. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity. Obviously there\u2019s a bit of needle there with De La Hoya and Canelo, so that might be the more interesting sell on the fight week. Munguia\u2019s a willing participant. He done a number on me; he truly deserves his crack. \u201cI think Canelo wins. I think it\u2019ll be close. Munguia will get off to a good start \u2013 might even go three, four rounds up, maybe. But I think Canelo will come on strong the second half of the fight and make it his own. He\u2019s too accurate and he\u2019s got the lasting effect in his shots. He\u2019ll grind Munguia down, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll stop him, but I think he\u2019ll beat him on points..\n\nQuestion: Who does De La Hoya predict will beat this Boxer?\nAnswers:\nA.

It\u2019s currently on track for release soon. Columbia has set a series of deadlines for protesters to leave the encampment \u2014 which they have missed \u2014 but bringing back police \u201cat this time\u201d would be counterproductive, the school wrote in an email to students. On Sunday, students walked among dozens of colorful tents that continue to stand. CALIFORNIA Protesters opposing and supporting Israel shouted and shoved each other during dueling demonstrations Sunday at the University of California, Los Angeles. Local media showed footage of police setting up barricades before hundreds of people on both sides joined a growing crowd at UCLA\u2019s Dickson court, near where pro-Palestinian students have been staying around-the-clock in tents. Counter-protesters who organized a \u201cStand in Support of Jewish Students\u201d rally said their goal was to \u201cstand up against hatred and antisemitism. Overnight, pro-Palestinian protesters expanded their campus encampment outside to stretch from the top of the Janss Steps to the east end of Royce Hall. The growing number of pro-Palestinian protesters has been met with an equally fervent group of counter-protesters who have played loud music near the encampment and shouted chants about Palestinian preceded by an obscenity, according to the Daily Bruin, UCLA's student newspaper. One counter-protester stomped on a Palestinian flag at the encampment while another ripped posters off the exterior of the encampment, the Daily Bruin reported. As of Sunday morning, groups supporting the counter-protesters had raised $64,478 on GoFundMe to support Bruins for Israel, more the twice the initial $26,000 goal. The makeshift cluster of more than 50 camping tents for the pro- Palestinian protesters began forming early Thursday and continued to grow over the weekend. However, multiple groups, including the human rights organization Jewish Voice for Peace, have questioned the actions taken early Saturday morning. \"We denounce Northeastern University\u2019s discipline of student activists and Boston Police Department's arrest of peaceful protesters,\" a written statement said in part. \"We denounce false claims from the Northeastern administration that protests were \"infiltrated by professional organizers\" who used \"virulent antisemitic slurs. \"\"By using the actions of counter protesters to slander their own students, the Northeastern University administration is acting in incredible bad faith,\" Jewish Voice for Peace said in the written statement. A spokesperson for Boston police said the department did not make any arrests, but when requested, they helped transported some of the people who were students to jail. \"The fact that the phrase 'Kill the Jews' was shouted on our campus is not in dispute,\" Renata Nyul, vice president of communications for Northeastern University said. The dueling demonstrations involved at least some people from outside the university, which issued a statement on Sunday saying it had allowed two groups on campus to express their views. Members of the Harriet Tubman Center for Social Justice planned to support the right of students to protest, according to the statement, while Stand in Support of Jewish Students, in partnership with Israeli-American Council, planned to oppose hatred and antisemitism on campus. After the clash, the UCLA campus police department said it had dispatched more officers to the scene, and that city police were not involved. A representative of the campus police said no arrests had been made. In the past two weeks, pro-Palestinian protests have spread to college campuses across the U. S. m. Among the speakers at the pro-Israel rally was Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli American Council. \u201cWe will take back our campuses, from Columbia to UCLA and everywhere in between,\u201d he told the crowd, according to the Daily Bruin. No arrests were reported as of midday Sunday. \u201cThis morning, a group of demonstrators breached a barrier that the university had established separating two groups of protesters on our campus, resulting in physical altercations,\u201d Mary Osako, vice chancellor of UCLA Strategic Communications, said in a statement. \u201cUCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken about the violence that broke out. Fights broke out at UCLA Sunday, April 28 among pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel supporters after a barrier that was meant to separate the dueling groups of demonstrators was breached. A group called Stand With Us held a rally to show support for Jewish students after days of often intense pro-Palestinian protests at campuses across the United States, including at crosstown USC. The rally was co-sponsored by the United Jewish Coalition in partnership with the Israel American Council and several other organizations. Members of the Harriet Tubman Center for Social Justice also held a demonstration \u2014 that one to support students\u2019 right to protest, in response to a request from pro-Palestine protesters at the campus. According to the Daily Bruin, members of both groups faced off on the lawn between Haines Hall and Kaplan Hall on Sunday morning. Fights broke out at UCLA today among pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel supporters after a barrier was breached meant to separate the dueling groups of demonstrators. A group called Stand With Us scheduled an 11 a. m. rally to show support for Jewish students after days of often intense pro-Palestinian protests at campuses across the United States, including at crosstown USC. The rally was co-sponsored by the United Jewish Coalition in partnership with the Israel American Council and several related organizations. Members of the Harriet Tubman Center for Social Justice scheduled a 9:30 a. m. demonstration to support students' right to protest, in response to a request from pro-Palestine protesters at the campus. Dueling demonstrations on the UCLA campus by pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups turned physical Sunday after demonstrators breached the physical barrier the school said it established to separate the groups. In a statement by UCLA, Mary Osako, vice chancellor for Strategic Communications, said that a group of demonstrators had breached a barrier intended to separate the two groups of protesters. Osako said this resulted in \"physical altercations. \" She went on to share: \"UCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest. We are heartbroken about the violence that broke out. \" The two groups included pro-Palestinian protesters and a permitted counterdemonstration by the United Jewish Coalition in partnership with the Israeli American Council (IAC) and other related groups.

The lawsuit alleges, in part, that the Biden administration has overstepped its legal authority in extending the regulations to apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It also contends that the rule, if carried out, could affect issues such as which bathrooms that transgender students can use in schools. It includes allegations that the rule, which is scheduled to take effect Aug. 1, is \u201carbitrary and capricious. \u201d The U. S. Department of Education announced the rule on April 19. Schools, colleges and universities that receive federal money are required to comply with Title IX. The rule and resulting lawsuit came after numerous political and legal fights in Florida and other Republican-controlled states in recent years about LGBTQ issues. Those fights have involved such things as efforts to prevent transgender students from using school bathrooms that don\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth and to prevent transgender female students from participating on girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports teams.

Additionally, the regulatory changes conflict with some state laws, the lawsuit claims. More Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Most controversial, the redefinition of sex to include \"gender identity\" means that males claiming to be female and wanting to use women's locker rooms, or play on women's sports teams, can now claim that Title IX gives them that right. Ironically, women's athletics only exist in their present form, especially at the college level, because Title IX was interpreted decades ago to mandate not just equal athletic opportunity but equal funding for female sports programs. All this must now yield, however, to the yet more transgressive phenomenon of sex identity politics. Girls uncomfortable with guys watching them undress? Parents angry? Biden says: Get over it!

As was the case when Matthew Tkachuk cashed in on a misplayed puck in overtime of Game 5, all it takes is one critical miscue or timely save to swing the momentum. As such, urgency has been the primary focus for the Bruins. \u201cI hate this, personally, those two days between games, because you just want to keep playing,\u201d noted David Pastrnak. \u201cI\u2019m glad we are only one day away, and I can\u2019t wait for tomorrow already.

The Panthers didn't downplay it: Monday night's win meant a lot. All three playoff series between the two teams have come in the last four years, with Tampa Bay winning the first one 4-2 in 2021 and then sweeping Florida in 2022.

Andrei Vasilevsky stopped 33 shots. Verhaeghe opened scoring for the Panthers with a four-on-four goal just 45 seconds into the second period. Verhaeghe grabbed his own rebound and wristed a shot past Vasilevsky. Barkov gave Florida a 2-0 lead when he pounced on a rebound for a short-handed goal -- his first of the playoffs -- at 7:22 of the second period.

The Lightning are a year older, and like most big brothers, they have hit some milestones first. The Panthers got to the Stanley Cup Final before the Lightning ever sniffed it, but not long after, Tampa Bay pulled ahead and won not one, not two, but three Stanley Cups. In 2021, the two teams met in the playoffs for the first time. The Lightning won four games to two en route to a title. The next year, Tampa Bay swept them out of the postseason. But now the Panthers finally have bragging rights over big brother, eliminating the Lightning from the playoffs with a 6-1 win at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, closing out a 4-1 series victory. \"We're gonna be playing probably our next biggest rival, so there will be no emotional letdown,\" Florida forward Matthew Tkachuk said. \"Whoever we play, it's going to be another very intense, another fun series to be a part of. \" The Panthers overcame a 3-1 series deficit against the Bruins in the first round of last year's playoffs, defeating Boston 4-3 in overtime of Game 7 to eliminate a dominant Bruins team that had set a regular-season record with 63 wins.

Barkov added a shorthanded goal in Game 5 to help secure the series. The Panthers excelled at keeping the Lightning out of the offensive zone and breaking up entry passes early, which helped swing the momentum in their favor after each kill. It proved to be the death blow in the series-clincher, where they went 3-for-3. \u201cWhen the pressure was the most extreme, guys made plays,\u201d Florida coach Paul Maurice said. \u201cThat takes some courage.

PHOENIX \u2014 The Minnesota Timberwolves are off to the second round of the NBA playoffs for the first time in 20 years. Their first-round sweep of the Phoenix Suns served notice they might be ready to go even deeper. Anthony Edwards scored 40 points, Karl-Anthony Towns added 28 and the Timberwolves pulled away late to beat the Suns 122-116 on Sunday night and sweep the first-round playoff series. The victory came after coach Chris Finch left the game late in the fourth after an inadvertent collision with Wolves guard Mike Conley.

The 35-year-old Durant \u2014 who Edwards said was his favorite player growing up \u2014 offered nothing but praise for the young star. \u201cSo impressed with Ant,\u201d Durant said. \u201cMy favorite player to watch.

Edwards' shining light and Durant's eclipse marked a generational shift in the NBA. The new era of the NBA is getting closer and closer. Anthony Edwards' Rush and the New Generation of the NBA The new generation of the NBA has arrived. That was confirmed by 22-year-old Minnesota Timberwolves , Anthony Edwards , at Phoenix Suns , Footprint Center Stadium, Monday (29/4/2024). They might get another crack at them soon. The Wolves were a handful for the Suns throughout the series, flashing a deep roster that includes veteran point guard Mike Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, defensive star Rudy Gobert, sixth man of the year Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels. But there's little doubt Edwards and Towns lead the show. Edwards had just nine points in the first half before unloading on the Suns after the break, which was enough to overcome Booker's 49 points. His powerful, one-handed jam late in the fourth sealed the win. \"That was the gameplan, get everyone involved,\" Edwards said. \"But in the second half, it's time to win.

Kool-Aid If you\u2019re a football fan, chances are that you\u2019ve heard the name Kool-Aid McKinstry. The Crimson Tide cornerback grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and went on to play in Tuscaloosa where, in 2023, he was named first-team All-American. In the recent 2024 NFL draft, Kool-Aid McKinstry was a second-round draft pick for the New Orleans Saints. Kool-Aid is just a nickname, however. Born Ga\u2019Quincy McKinstry, the story goes that his grandmother called him \u201cKool-Aid\u201d at birth because he was born with a big smile, just like the Kool-Aid Man. The nickname stuck, and \u201cKool-Aid\u201d became McKinstry\u2019s official roster name. In fact, he\u2019s the first player named Kool-Aid to be drafted into the NFL\u2014it\u2019s even how New Orleans Saints Head Coach Dennis Allen addressed the player in the life-changing phone call. \"Don't solve a little bit of this problem, a little bit of that problem. Identify what your biggest weakness is and attack it with ferocity. And that was their secondary and they went out and go two of the top four corners in the draft. \" Philadelphia picked up cornerbacks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean with its first and second-round picks. Instead of going with a player from a Power 5 school as they have in previous years, the Eagles selected Mitchell, who played in the Mid-American Conference at Toledo. The Eagles picked Mitchell over the other top cornerback in the draft, University of Alabama's Terrion Arnold, who was selected two picks later by the Detroit Lions. Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell celebrates with fans after being chosen by the Philadelphia Eagles with the 22nd overall pick during the first round of the NFL football draft, Thursday, April 25, 2024, in Detroit. (Jeff Lewis/AP Images for the NFL) Jeff Lewis / AP Mitchell and Arnold's careers will be tied together, but Mitchell should challenge Eagles cornerback James Bradberry for the starting job in Week 1. In Mitchell, the Eagles are getting a player with a \"gumbo of traits\" who set Toledo's record for pass breakups. PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- The Philadelphia Eagles drafted nine new players in the 2024 NFL draft as general manager Howie Roseman wheeled and dealt his way up and down the draft board to add to his 2025 stockpile. And that wasn't all the Eagles did over the three-day event. The Birds agreed to a three-year contract extension with wideout A. J. Brown right before the first round. Below are grades for each pick the Eagles made in the 2024 NFL draft. Round 1, Toledo CB Quinyon Mitchell Heading into the draft, the Eagles desperately needed to add young talent to their secondary, and they accomplished that by adding arguably the best cornerback in the draft by selecting Quinyon Mitchell out of the University of Toledo. The Birds stayed put at No. 22, but he kept falling down the board on Day 2, which led the Eagles to trade up and select him at 40th overall. IOWA CITY, IA - NOVEMBER 11: Iowa Hawkeyes left cornerback Cooper DeJean (3) as seen during a college football game between the Rutgers Scarlet Knights and the Iowa Hawkeyes on November 11, 2023, at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, IA. Keith Gillett/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images DeJean, a first-round talent, didn't allow a touchdown on 374 coverage snaps last season and can play cornerback and safety. Like C. J. Gardner-Johnson, DeJean is another chess piece new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio can use against opposing offenses. DeJean and Mitchell should become young cornerstones in Philadelphia's secondary for years to come. The Green Bay Packers made 11 selections in the 2024 NFL draft, starting with offensive lineman Jordan Morgan at No. 25 overall in the first round and ending with cornerback Kalen King at No. 255 overall in the seventh round. It\u2019s time to break down the class. Best picks. Sleepers. Winners. Losers. Strategy. Let\u2019s dig in. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Packers\u2019 draft class in 2024:. At Iowa, DeJean was a top-tier outside CB but he also played the \u201cCash\" position, essentially a rover that was a hybrid safety-linebacker. NFL teams were conflicted with some projecting DeJean to CB and others to the nickel or safety. The last player with DeJean-like versatility in Philadelphia was former Pro Bowl defensive back Malcolm Jenkins. The current comp might be Minnesota\u2019s Josh Metellus, who played everywhere in Brian Flores; unique defense. Where DeJean winds might even vary from play to play. \u201cI\u2019m a football player,\u201d DeJean said. \u201cYou put me on the field and I\u2019m going to go play football, whether it\u2019s inside, outside, at safety, wherever it is. \u201d MORE NFL: Newest Eagles Cornerback Draws Comparison To Seven-Time Pro Bowl Select. Hill has experience from his days at Michigan as an outside and nickel corner. The Bengals expect him to battle for playing time with second-year outside corner DJ Turner on the outside -- opposite Cam Taylor-Britt -- and Mike Hilton as the nickel cornerback. \"One of the reasons you took him was because of all the various things you'd seen on tape from him,\" Taylor said. \"He's a superb athlete, he's got great size, and he did a good amount of coverage at Michigan, playing inside covering slots, played some outside. The versatility is what made him the pick that he was. We're really excited for his future.

Neither was former Alabama coach Nick Saban. He said on the broadcast that Mitchell would\u2019ve been Alabama\u2019s No. 1 target in the transfer portal, \u201cand he would never get in the portal. \u201d For the Eagles, Mitchell playing in the MAC was also a strength. Said Roseman, \u201cWe wanted to bring in people here who had a chip on their shoulder. \u201d GO DEEPER NFL Draft 2024 winners and losers: Eagles, Steelers stand out; why did Raiders pass on QB? Most surprising pick The Eagles selected another cornerback immediately after picking Mitchell. But Iowa\u2019s Cooper DeJean is an intriguing anomaly. To say he\u2019s a cornerback ignores his versatility as a potential safety. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Who needs to draft prospects from the Power Five to build a Super Bowl contender? The Philadelphia Eagles might soon find out after taking an unconventional approach in the NFL draft. General manager Howie Roseman used a first-round pick on Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell and a third-round selection on Houston Christian linebacker Jalyx Hunt. Surely those two were on every Eagles fan\u2019s mock draft board. Only the most diehard college football fans in Philadelphia \u2014 of which there are few \u2014 and the most dogged Eagles scouts \u2014 of which there are many \u2014 had much of a report on Mitchell or Hunt. While the picks seemed outside the box, Roseman said it\u2019s not out of the ordinary to find players of that caliber out of more than 400 scouting reports that he receives. Grade: A Round 5, Pick 155: Jeremiah Trotter Jr. , LB, Clemson This was my favorite pick of the draft, and if you\u2019re an Eagles fan, it probably was for you, too. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. played high school football at St. Joe\u2019s Prep in Philadelphia. Oh, and his father, Jeremiah Trotter, is in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame. People will talk about him being undersized, or he did not test as well in this test or that test for the combine or his pro day, I get it. You have to go through the process, and some things matter more than others. However, I also believe in everything happening for a reason, and the Eagles getting Trotter, who will wear No. 54 like his father did \u2013 it\u2019s perfect. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. ESPN\u2019s Jordan Reid pegged Suamataia\u2019s selection as his favorite pick of the draft, citing Kansas City\u2019s ability to trust young offensive linemen to perform well early in their careers. \u201cI\u2019m going with an under-the-radar move here. In the aforementioned deep offensive tackle class, Suamataia got a bit lost in the shuffle. But he ultimately landed in the perfect spot in Kansas City,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThe Chiefs have a huge need at left tackle, and they don\u2019t shy away from playing offensive linemen early; they saw near-immediate success from Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith on the interior. So, Suamataia has the potential to contribute as a rookie. He has exciting traits, including lower-half suddenness, and certainly could develop into a dependable starter. Daniel Jeremiah, Bucky Brooks and Rhett Lewis are back together to recap all the action from the 2024 NFL Draft in a new episode of Move the Sticks. To start off, the guys give their overall takeaways from the draft (:22). Next, the trio goes through the top 10 picks of the draft (8:52). After, the crew does a deep dive on the Falcons' surprising pick of Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. with their eighth overall pick (24:23). Then, DJ lists his top five draft classes (39:27). To wrap up the show, the trio gives its final thoughts (47:56). Former USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams is finally an NFL signal caller. Williams is said to have dreamed about being in this position for a long time, and it finally came true on Thursday when the Chicago Bears selected him with the No. 1 overall pick. It's a dream come true, but the work has just started for the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner. It won't be easy, as every rookie quarterback has gone through struggles. However, Williams is confident that as long as he's himself, he will be just fine. The 22-year-old told reporters in Chicago, including Dan Wiederer of The Chicago Tribune. \"I don't think about it, to be honest with you,\" Williams said. \"I think about just doing my job, handling the things I can handle, dealing with the small things, holding everybody accountable and everybody holding me accountable. Now we will turn our attention to mini-camps, OTAs, and training camp before having a true idea of what to expect from the Commanders in 2024. Stick with CommanderGameday for more coverage of the Washington Commanders throughout the 2024 season. Follow Caleb on Twitter. 30. And the Atlanta Falcons followed suit on Pitts, who has 149 receptions for 2,049 yards and six touchdowns since being taken fourth overall. He made the Pro Bowl as a rookie when he had 68 receptions for 1,026 yards, setting a franchise record for receiving yards by a first-year player. Pitts sustained a season-ending knee injury after playing 10 games in 2022 and managed 53 catches for 667 yards and three touchdowns a season ago as the Falcons struggled to settle on a starting quarterback. Atlanta is counting on Pitts\u2019 production to pick up after the signing of Kirk Cousins to a $180 million deal and the drafting of Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 overall selection. The Jacksonville Jaguars, meanwhile, exercised options on former Clemson teammates Trevor Lawrence and running back Travis Etienne. \ud83d\udc4f  \ud83d\udcfa: 2024 #NFLDraft on NFL Network/ESPN/ABC pic. twitter. com/qsFoCVcBWy \u2014 Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) April 27, 2024 After the announcement, Flores\u2019 girlfriend who accompanied him on the trip, celebrated the announcement and the efforts of the mechanical engineer who became a Cowboys fan thanks to the influence of his late father.

The Bengals expect him to battle for playing time with second-year outside corner DJ Turner on the outside -- opposite Cam Taylor-Britt -- and Mike Hilton as the nickel cornerback. \"One of the reasons you took him was because of all the various things you'd seen on tape from him,\" Taylor said. \"He's a superb athlete, he's got great size, and he did a good amount of coverage at Michigan, playing inside covering slots, played some outside.

He has done a tremendous job embracing this opportunity, and I'm excited to see him go out there and compete. \". 22, but he kept falling down the board on Day 2, which led the Eagles to trade up and select him at 40th overall. IOWA CITY, IA - NOVEMBER 11: Iowa Hawkeyes left cornerback Cooper DeJean (3) as seen during a college football game between the Rutgers Scarlet Knights and the Iowa Hawkeyes on November 11, 2023, at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, IA. Keith Gillett/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images DeJean, a first-round talent, didn't allow a touchdown on 374 coverage snaps last season and can play cornerback and safety. Like C. J.

Mitchell AND DeJean? HELLO. Packers draft pick Kalen King had support from wide receiver Jayden Reed, Jets All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner as he fell to seventh round Kalen King wasn't the only person who felt he should have been picked much higher than when the Green Bay Packers finally selected the cornerback late in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL draft. His new Packers teammate wide receiver Jayden Reed, who went head-to-head against him in college, had some thoughts about how far King fell. \"Bro ain't no 7th rounder,\" Reed tweeted after the Penn State defensive back was taken with the 255th overall pick and third-to-last selection in the entire draft. Reed, a Packers second-round pick in 2023 out of Michigan State, knows the talent King can be. Reed's and King's paths crossed for two years in the Big Ten in 2021 and 2022. Philadelphia fans certainly should be excited about the team after a great draft The Philadelphia Eagles made a specific effort to bolster its secondary throughout the 2024 National Football League Draft. Philadelphia is loaded with talent but its secondary was a point of weakness. It doesn't seem like that is the case any longer as the Eagles drafted arguably the top two cornerback prospects in the 2024 draft class. The Eagles selected former Toledo corner Quinyon Mitchell with the No. 22 overall pick and followed it up by taking former Iowa corner Cooper DeJean with the No. 40 overall pick after a trade with the Washington Commanders. DeJean was considered the top cornerback prospect by Pro Football Focus and the No. 8 overall prospect so it's surprising that he fell so far in the draft. Plus, learn the sweet story behind Ga\u2019Quincy \u201cKool-Aid\u201d McKinstry\u2019s nickname. Kool-Aid If you\u2019re a football fan, chances are that you\u2019ve heard the name Kool-Aid McKinstry. The Crimson Tide cornerback grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and went on to play in Tuscaloosa where, in 2023, he was named first-team All-American. In the recent 2024 NFL draft, Kool-Aid McKinstry was a second-round draft pick for the New Orleans Saints. Kool-Aid is just a nickname, however. Born Ga\u2019Quincy McKinstry, the story goes that his grandmother called him \u201cKool-Aid\u201d at birth because he was born with a big smile, just like the Kool-Aid Man. The nickname stuck, and \u201cKool-Aid\u201d became McKinstry\u2019s official roster name. In fact, he\u2019s the first player named Kool-Aid to be drafted into the NFL\u2014it\u2019s even how New Orleans Saints Head Coach Dennis Allen addressed the player in the life-changing phone call. If growing pains do come around, it happens with a lot of players. You deal with it in that moment. You handle it. But I don't think about it. \" Williams will start from step one, just like he did at USC in 2022. People doubted him then, saying it would be a rebuilding year for USC and that their chances of making the College Football Playoff were dim. Instead, Williams and his team shocked the college football world, recording an 11-1 record and being one win shy of making the College Football Playoff. The former All-American will look to shock the football world once again and lead the Bears to new heights right out of the gate. It won't be easy, but Williams was selected No. 1 overall to do the impossible. \u201cThey\u2019re the best players,\u201d Roseman said. \u201cThe SEC guys are still playing against great competition. I think these were kind of two extenuating circumstances because of the particular guys. Probably wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s going to be a trend. \u201d The Eagles stuck to picks from more familiar football schools with 2023 All-America cornerback Cooper DeJean of Iowa in the second round and Clemson running back Will Shipley in the fourth. \u201cOnce you draft them, it\u2019s what they do in the NFL,\u201d Roseman said. \u201cWe bring them in here and we talk about it a lot, we got to develop the player and the person. We\u2019re still talking about a young guy coming to Philadelphia, and I think at this point it\u2019s all what he does from here. Whatever happened pre-draft, none of that matters. Wherever they\u2019re picked, none of that matters. \" And he's going to use it as motivation. \"I feel like this experience I got these past three days, nothing but a humbling experience for me,\" King said. \"It's gonna add fuel to the fire. There have been a lot of doubters in my ear, a lot of doubters on me for the past couple. It's always going to be there, so I'm not really worried about those people. I know what I'm capable of and I'm ready to show the world what I can do. \" Get to know the rookies: Here's an interesting fact about each Packers draft pick This article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Kalen King gets support from Jets' Sauce Gardner during 2024 NFL draft. His shining moment came in the game against Reed's Spartans. In the Nittany Lions' 35-16 win over the Spartans, King had a career-high five pass breakups, four solo tackles and a fourth-quarter interception. That performance helped him earn second-team All-American honors. Kalen King reacts to a defensive stop during a game against the Wisconsin Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium during his first collegiate game in 2021. King was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL draft. King didn't record an interception during his junior season in 2023 and his stock plummeted. Seeing King drop so far in the draft also baffled New York Jets star cornerback Sauce Gardner. Gardner knows King's game as well. Gardner grew up in Detroit with King and played in the same high school football conference..\n\nQuestion: Who did this NFL team select as their top cornerback in the draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

Former Oklahoma guard Otega Oweh \u2014 who spent the last two seasons with the Sooners \u2014 announced Saturday that he would be transferring to Kentucky. Prior to his signing with UK, Oweh was on a recruiting visit to Kentucky on Thursday. That same day, Pope, the new UK coach, was spotted at Keeneland with legendary former UK basketball player Dan Issel. In addition to Kentucky, Oweh had taken recruiting visits as a transfer portal player to Oregon and Texas A&M. Oweh announced his plans to enter the transfer portal on March 25. Oweh, who stands 6-foot-5, started 37 times and made 60 career appearances for the Sooners over the last two seasons. During the 2023-24 season, Oweh made 28 starts and played in 32 games, averaging 11. He can block shots with both hands and improved his positioning in drop pick-and-roll coverage throughout the season. While he played a role in Oklahoma State having one of the Big 12\u2019s worst defenses, he, like the team\u2019s other bigs, was often hung out to dry by guards failing to stay in front of anyone. With more experience and in a more structured scheme, I expect Garrison to become a serious impact defender. On offense, Garrison\u2019s range doesn\u2019t extend far beyond finishing around the rim. However, I liked him most in ball-screens, where he showcased his mobility and created a great target for his guards with well-timed rolls. Garrison also flashed serious passing chops in hand-offs and give-and-gos with his guards, as well as in short rolls and the pivot.

Almost everything comes around the basket for Osobor, specifically with his back to the basket. Osobor averaged more post possessions per game this season than all but five players nationally, per Synergy. His effectiveness came as part of a Utah State offense that wasn\u2019t loaded with shot creators or outside shooters. Osobor is terrific at establishing post position deep in the paint. He uses his lack of height to his advantage, getting lower than his man to gain leverage and keep space. He\u2019s also really sharp at keeping his dribble alive to create an angle, then exploding toward the rim with jump stops and other moves. He\u2019ll deploy well-timed drop stops to get to layups or dunks, or work toward quick floaters over the top of bigs. 3 percent this past season.

Moore Ht: 6-2 Wt: 160 McCollum was one of the best scoring guards in the Big 12. He averaged 13. 3 points and 3. 3 assists at OU, proving he can be productive at the high-major level. He\u2019s small, but he can fly and shake defenders with his speed and handle, whether in isolation or when playing out of the pick-and-roll, as he often did at OU. He\u2019s one of the rare players who shoots it better off the dribble than the catch. Last season, he made only 25. 6 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers, per Synergy, while shooting 39. Ivi\u0161i\u0107, who has three years of eligibility remaining, missed 15 games last season but still averaged 5. 5 points, 3. 3 rebounds and 1. 3 blocks per game.

Before coming to Kentucky, Ivi\u0161i\u0107 played in the FIBA U20 European Championship for his home country of Croatia. He also played for two seasons in the Adriatic League for Montenegro's professional basketball club. The four-star forward out of Overtime Elite committed to Arkansas on Monday, and it was no surprise to anyone. Knox, a top-20 recruit in the 2024 class, was previously committed to Calipari at Kentucky. Five-star guard Boogie Fland wrapped up his visit to Fayetteville on Thursday with a commitment to Arkansas. He wanted to get back to the tournament and redeem himself, and while the Owls lost in the first round to Northwestern, Goldin was terrific, scoring 19 points on 5-of-6 shooting and 9-of-11 at the free throw line to go along with nine rebounds and four blocks. Goldin is one of the best back-to-the-basket players in college basketball. Last season, he scored 1. 203 points per possession on post-ups, per Synergy. He takes pride in being able to shoot equally well with either hand and can score over either shoulder. If he gets close to the basket, he will dunk it with authority. His aggressiveness went up this season as his confidence grew, allowing him to bump his scoring average up from 10. 2 points as a junior to 15. 7 points as a senior.

He and Liedel are working out in Erie regularly and head to Kalamazoo a couple times each week to be with teammates. \u201cI really meshed well with the guys,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what my expectations were, but it was a great season. I\u2019m really excited coming into next season. I think we have the ability to win a national championship. \u201d This article originally appeared on The Monroe News: Kalamazoo Valley basketball led by old teammates Liedel, Sweeney. Pope hasn't had any time to ease into returning to his alma mater as he continues to try to fill Kentucky's roster for a program with lofty expectations every season. Kentucky has made the NCAA Tournament the last three seasons and 29 of the last 33 years and those expectations won't change for fans with Pope taking over. Join CatsPause to see the latest on all of Kentucky's roster changes. Kentucky basketball news, roster Kentucky hosted 6-foot-9 Andrew Carr after the forward played his last two seasons at Wake Forest after spending his first two years at Delaware. Carr averaged 13. 5 points and 6. 8 rebounds last season. He shot 52. 6% from the floor and can also stretch the floor, averaging a made 3-pointer while shooting 37. 1% from beyond the arc last season. 3 assists at OU, proving he can be productive at the high-major level. He\u2019s small, but he can fly and shake defenders with his speed and handle, whether in isolation or when playing out of the pick-and-roll, as he often did at OU. He\u2019s one of the rare players who shoots it better off the dribble than the catch. Last season, he made only 25. 6 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers, per Synergy, while shooting 39. 3 percent off the bounce. That\u2019s one reason his overall 3-point percentage dropped to 31. 4 percent at Oklahoma after he made 37. 5 percent of his 3s over his first two seasons at Sienna College. He did shoot 38. 6 percent in catch-and-shoot situations in that span, so it\u2019s possible he can be better in that area for his new team. \u201cI truly believe in coach Gard and his coaching staff, without a doubt,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt's just time for me to go out there and do my part and put the work in. Because I know they're gonna do their part and coach me. \u201d With Hunter committed, the Badgers can move on to pursuing a transfer wing and big man with their remaining two open scholarships. Wisconsin had eight departures this offseason \u2014 seven via the transfer portal \u2014 but only five were on scholarship and the Badgers are also set to add two freshmen in Freitag and forward Jack Robison next season.

Pitts, the No. 4 pick in the 2021 NFL draft, has put together a pair of disappointing seasons since his breakout rookie campaign. He recorded 53 receptions for 667 yards and three touchdowns in 2023, at times taking a backseat to fellow tight end Jonnu Smith. The Falcons fired coach Arthur Smith in a move they hope will ultimately allow Pitts to emerge into one of the sport's premier pass-catching tight ends. Pitts recorded 68 receptions for 1,026 yards and a touchdown as a rookie in 2021, becoming the second rookie tight end in NFL history to top the 1,000-yard mark. Kansas City Chiefs general manager Brett Veach says the team has no immediate plans to go after free agents following the conclusion of last week\u2019s NFL Draft. KC filled in its two biggest perceived areas of need with its first two picks, selecting receiver Xavier Worthy in the first round and offensive tackle Kingsley Suamataia in the second. \u201cWe accomplished a lot between the free-agency period and the draft,\u201d Veach said in a Zoom call with reporters Monday. \u201cAnd now I think we\u2019ll have a chance to really evaluate these young guys, and evaluate these new players we brought in on our 90-man signings right after the season and with the undrafted free-agent guys we got. So we\u2019ll have a chance to evaluate this team. \u201d Veach emphasized that a front office is never fully satisfied with its roster and always looks to improve. 8 overall in 2023, he may want to renegotiate his rookie deal. But that's a problem for way down the line and would be a good problem for the Falcons to have. He makes up for the slight frame by using his 32-inch arms to get physical in press man coverage and jam receivers off the line of scrimmage. Rakestraw joins a talented secondary headlined by cornerback Carlton Davis, safety Brian Branch and fellow rookie Terrion Arnold. He could shine down the road in this defense. Best pick (A): RB Marshawn Lloyd, USC (Round 3, Pick 88) Older but ultra-sudden thick RB with glimpses of special elusiveness. Speed is a plus to his game. Has a lot of tread left on his tires because he was low-volume back in college. Fumbling issues. Perfect speed acquisition to this stretch-run offense. (Chris Trapasso) Worst pick (C+): LB Ty'ron Hopper, Missouri (Round 3, Pick 91) Ultra-physical off-ball LB. 24. Dolphins: Davison Igbinosun, DB, Ohio State Another New Jersey native, Igbinosun prepped at Union High before playing one year at Mississippi State and ultimately landing in Columbus. A long, rangy defensive back, Igbinosun stands 6-foot-2, 190 pounds and has the versatility to play corner or safety. For the record, his full name is Aimuamwosa Davison Igbinosun. 25. Cowboys: Malaki Starks, S, Georgia The Cowboys make Starks the 18th Georgia Bulldog selected in the first round since 2018. Starks started in 2022 as a true freshman and had two interceptions, 68 tackles and seven pass defenses and then added three INTs, 52 tackles and seven pass knockdowns last year. Starks is a solidly built 6-foot-1, 205 pounds, and plays physical when lined up in press coverage and fast, fluid and instinctive in the open field. Commanding presence against the run also. Grabbing those two, along with Clemson DL Tyler Davis, will help soften the blow of losing Donald. 0 million. It seems odd that a rookie contract is slotted to where a player is drafted, but the fifth-year option on that contract is tied to his position. It works out for the Falcons though. Pitts was a Pro Bowler his rookie season with Matt Ryan as his quarterback. He struggled with injuries and inconsistent quarterback play in 2022 and 2023. He's still just 23-years old, 5-months younger than Atlanta's first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. , and still oozes talent and upside. $10. 9 million is a relatively cheap gamble for the Falcons to take on his fully-guaranteed option year. They'll have a decision to make on Drake London next year. London has yet to make a Pro Bowl, but he'll easily make the playing time bonus. Ben Sinnott snap alignment in 2023 season, per Pro Football Focus: POSITION SNAP ALIGNMENT RATE Inline Tight End 63% Slot 22% Backfield 11. 6% Wide 3. 3% Offensive Line 0. 1%* * One snap Kansas State used him much more as a receiver in 2023 as he totaled career highs across the board in catches (49), receiving yards (575) and receiving touchdowns (six). Sinnott's route running has room for improvement while already solid, and it will be fun to see how new Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury opts to deploy him. NFC North Best pick (A-): QB Caleb Williams, USC (Round 1, Pick 1) They say he's generational, and he might be, but there are some concerns. I like his game, but I would have taken Jayden Daniels. Only time will tell. Packers keep Graham in the Midwest. 23. Jets: Jalen Milroe, QB, Alabama Aaron Rodgers has to retire sometime and the Jets go QB in the first round for the third time in eight years (Sam Darnold third in 2018, Zach Wilson second in 2023). The 6-foot-2, 220-pound Milroe showed tremendous growth during the 2023 season and with another year of experience and seasoning could be a big-time prospect in 2025. Milroe has a big arm and plus athleticism, and while he\u2019s got some technique things to work on, streamlining his unorthodox delivery and making better decisions in the pocket, he has an enormous ceiling and could very well be a 1st-round lock a year from now. Best in that role or as a spy. Long way to go in coverage. Another linebacker? (Chris Trapasso)  Most interesting pick (B+): LB Edgerrin Cooper, Texas A&M (Round 2, Pick 45) The Packers were able to select arguably the top inside linebacker in the entire 2024 NFL Draft class, Texas A&M's Edgerrin Cooper, with a second-round pick. He has the speed (4. 51 40-yard dash) and length (34-inch arms) to be a strong, modern-day NFL inside linebacker with his 6-foot-2, 230-pound build. Cooper, a 2023 First Team All-American, led the SEC with 17. 0 tackles for loss last season, and he can be a nice contributor to new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley's Packers defense next to 2022 first-round pick linebacker Quay Walker.

Despite not having taken a snap at the professional level, Williams has been touted as one of the best college prospects in the last 10 years. The Bears' offense was already stacked with playmakers like wide receiver DJ Moore and tight end Cole Kmet, but the team also decided to make some huge additions in free agency. Former Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen and tight end Gerald Everett were acquired, giving the offense more weaponry. Adding Everett isn't exactly a home run effort, but Allen is. Leading up to his injury later in the season, Allen was keeping pace with the top receivers. He ended the 2023 campaign with 1,243 yards and five touchdowns. If growing pains do come around, it happens with a lot of players. You deal with it in that moment. You handle it. But I don't think about it. \" Williams will start from step one, just like he did at USC in 2022. People doubted him then, saying it would be a rebuilding year for USC and that their chances of making the College Football Playoff were dim. Instead, Williams and his team shocked the college football world, recording an 11-1 record and being one win shy of making the College Football Playoff. The former All-American will look to shock the football world once again and lead the Bears to new heights right out of the gate. It won't be easy, but Williams was selected No. 1 overall to do the impossible. Gregory Shamus/Getty Images It remains to be seen how it will translate to the actual field, but the Arizona Cardinals, Washington Commanders and Pittsburgh Steelers can all take solace in one thing. One of the most notable people in NFL media believe they won the 2024 draft. NFL Network's discussed the draft on Monday and said the Cardinals, Commanders and Steelers all had the best drafts based on his big board: Arizona landed arguably the best player in all of college football last season in wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. with the No. 4 overall pick. B/R's NFL Scouting Department ranked him as the top overall player on its latest big board, and he figures to be the No. 1 wide receiver as soon as his rookie season for the Cardinals. By RALPH D. RUSSO Even before the 2023 college football season kicked off, there was a fairly clear pecking order among quarterback prospects. Southern California\u2019s Caleb Williams was the presumptive QB1 and likely first overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft and North Carolina\u2019s Drake Maye was considered the most likely challenger to Williams. There was one big riser from the QB class in LSU\u2019s Jayden Daniels, who went from potential Day 2 selection to Heisman Trophy winner to No. 2 overall pick. As we look toward the 2024 college football season and the 2025 NFL draft, the depth of the talent pool looks deep ( thanks, NIL ) and unlike this season there should be plenty of defensive players in the first round. The quarterback pecking order is not so clear. Add in tight ends Cole Kmet and Gerald Everett and running backs D\u2019Andre Swift, Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson, and offensive coordinator Shane Waldron has the kind of good problems that should lead to long nights of preparation for opposing defensive coordinators. The first step is getting the newcomers acclimated at rookie minicamp, which begins May 10, with an introduction to the team\u2019s system, practice protocols, lifting and more so they can mesh seamlessly with veterans in the voluntary offseason program. There are no steps that can be skipped. Naturally, a ton of focus will be on Williams and how he adapts to what Waldron and the staff want to build around him. I liked all their second-round picks in defensive tackle Johnny Newton, corner Mike Sainristil and tight end Ben Sinnott. They drafted a lot of talented football players. \" Sometimes, we tend to just give higher grades to clubs with larger draft classes. This isn't that. Peters was on a heater all draft. And as Pete points out, the stellar mark was about much more than picking Daniels at No. 2 overall. 2.

Even as the value of offensive players skyrockets, the most coveted position on the defensive side of the football (edge) still creates enough value for a team to go No. 1. This begins with the loaded wide receiver room, with D. J. Moore, Keenan Allen and fellow Bears first-round pick Rome Odunze. Williams is already surrounded by weapons, which will hopefully ease his transition into the NFL. All in all, it's not surprising to see Bears fans rush out to get jerseys of the player who could very well change the fortunes of this franchise. If Williams succeeds in the NFL, this support will only continue to follow him in Chicago. More USC: Caleb Williams\u2019 Bears Merch Already Flying Off Shelves. When odds opened this time last year, Caleb Williams was already a massive -550 favorite to be the first pick, which ended up ringing true when the Bears made him their franchise quarterback Thursday. The 2024 NFL Draft broke records when it came to quarterbacks. Caleb Williams knew for months he was going to be the No. 1 overall pick; we did, too. There was no intrigue at the top. And for weeks there wasn\u2019t really much intrigue in picks 2 or 3. Washington was going to draft either Jayden Daniels or Drake Maye. New England was going to draft whichever quarterback was left \u2014 it never made sense trading the pick. What no one expected, however, is that a record 6 quarterbacks would come off the board in the first 12 picks. The run on offensive players was one thing, but it was the belief by so many teams that a future franchise quarterback could be found after the trio of Williams, Daniels, and Maye that caught people by surprise..\n\nQuestion: Who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft for this NFL team?\nAnswers:\nA.

The Patriots kicked things off by acquiring their hopeful franchise quarterback before surrounding him with help at receiver and on the offensive line. As great as the Patriots' draft was, there were a few things they possibly could have done better. Let's take a look at the biggest thing New England did not do during the draft, along with the one thing they definitely got right. Before we get started, here's a refresher of who the Patriots selected in this year's draft. The biggest thing they didn't do Honestly, I thought it was a foregone conclusion that the Patriots were going to trade the 49ers their second-round pick in exchange for 49ers wideout Brandon Aiyuk, as reports were suggesting they would. https://t. co/vaalH9SRlf \u2014 Phil Perry (@PhilAPerry) April 27, 2024 \"That's one big-picture critique that I have,\" Perry added. \"Could you have done a little bit more, in terms of trading up into the back end of the first round and making sure that you nab that guy that you really wanted?\" The Patriots went in the opposite direction, instead trading down from pick No. 34 to pick No. 37 in a deal with the Chargers, also receiving Los Angeles' No. 110 pick in exchange for pick No. 137. With Legette taken off the board at pick No. 32, it could be assumed that the Patriots liked Legette, and once he was no longer available, they decided to move down for Polk..\n\nQuestion: What was the biggest thing that this NFL team did not do during the draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

That\u2019s smart, sensible drafting with some of the moving parts the team has up front. \u2022 The Denver Broncos draft will be judged on Bo Nix. That said, for a team with just two picks in the top 100, landing a couple of skill guys in Oregon wide receiver Troy Franklin and Notre Dame running back Audric Estime\u2014both of whom could play right away and outperform their draft position\u2014merits some mention. \u2022 The Detroit Lions came into the offseason with a very clear corner need. They explored trading for L\u2019Jarius Sneed. They did a lower-end trade for Bucs veteran Carlton Davis. Not incredibly fast nor length with size. Awesome tackling reliability. Routinely finds and makes plays on the football underneath and at intermediate level. Has plus long speed. Spectacular value here. (Chris Trapasso) Worst pick (C-): QB Bo Nix, Oregon (Round 1, Pick 12) I don't love Nix, but I get the pick. Desperation forces teams to pick quarterbacks earlier than they should. Sean Payton obviously sees Drew Brees in him, but this is way early. Why not trade down and get him later? (Pete Prisco) Most interesting pick (A+): Troy Franklin, Oregon (Round 4, Pick 102) Denver needed to replenish its wide receiver room and land a speedster in Franklin. There are options at left tackle \u2014 particularly on the free agent market \u2014 but it\u2019s going to be interesting to see who wins that positional battle. On the wide receivers, I think they did as well as could be expected in getting a receiver I consider to be at the back end of tier one or an early tier-two guy in Polk. The only way they could have had a shot at Marvin Harrison Jr. , Rome Odunze, or Malik Nabers would have been to take one of them early (either at three or part of a smallish trade down) and go QB later in the first round. I think they made the right move. When watching some of the film I can get online, Drake Maye seems to have more than a touch of Trubisky in him. Both first-round edge Laiatu Latu and second-round WR Adonai Mitchell came with red flags. Both could be huge hits for GM Chris Ballard, or go the other way. Regardless, these are swings for the fences such as the selection of Anthony Richardson a year ago. \u2022 Sometimes you hear stuff leading up to the draft that winds up coming true on Thursday night\u2014and such was the case with the Jacksonville Jaguars, who did a ton of work on the receivers over the past two months. It matches, too, with how far they were willing to go to keep Calvin Ridley, even with contracts for Christian Kirk and Gabe Davis on the ledger. So they\u2019re committed to improving the skill-position talent around Trevor Lawrence. Now they just have to hope Brian Thomas Jr. \u201cHis energy, his aura. Obviously, up here (mentally). And that started at home. That discipline. He sitting there talking about. Everybody laughing and joking but you just came to the NFL, you just got drafted. You already got it up here, especially when it comes to spending your money. So if you already like that, if you already financially conscious like that, we aint got to worry about him. Now you take that same energy we just saw in that press conference, and you implement it on the field and be the same dog I\u2019m used to seeing at FSU? Shoot it\u2019s game over man,\u201d said Ochocinco. Sharpe expanded on those comments, saying, \u201cHe could be special, because you hear the way he talk. So that means advertisers and sponsors love him to get behind him. And with Slay and Bradberry still around, they can gradually move these guys into the lineup. \u2022 I figured the Pittsburgh Steelers would take either their top tackle or center Graham Barton at No. 20. They did the former in tabbing Washington\u2019s Troy Fautanu, then took care of the latter spot with Zach Frazier in the second round. But I\u2019m just as interested in third-rounder Roman Wilson at receiver. The Steelers did a lot of work on all the receivers coming into the draft, leading some to believe that was the position they\u2019d fill in the first round. Instead, they did what they generally do\u2014wait on the position. It\u2019s served them well in the past. We\u2019ll see if it does again with a guy who\u2019s been compared to Tyler Lockett. The team traded down from the No. 28 overall pick and allowed the Chiefs to trade Xavier Worthy. Then, they traded down again from No. 32 to allow the Panthers to select Xavier Legette. Those receivers will specifically be linked to the Bills and Coleman throughout his tenure. In any event, he has an opportunity to adopt a ton of targets left by Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis. Best pick (A): EDGE Cedric Johnson, Ole Miss (Round 6, Pick 214) Stocky defensive end with dynamic flashes. Love his swipe move, just wished he utilized it more frequently. Powerful player who has to be coached up on how to utilize his length better to keep blockers off him. Ascending rusher. I like this pick. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports \u2022 The San Francisco 49ers showed again that they don\u2019t care about your evaluation of a certain position by tabbing receiver Ricky Pearsall at No. 31. The former Florida star can run every route, is versatile enough to play all three receiver positions in the offense, and works and plays just as hard when he\u2019s not getting the ball. In the words of one staffer there, \u201cHis standard is our standard. \u201d And he does give the team some flexibility should a top-end offer come for Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel, the latter of whom I\u2019d now say would be more \u201cgettable\u201d for another team. I do think, in the end, they wind up hanging on to both for what sure looks like an all-in year. Let's circle back to Polk and Baker for a second. One of the things I like is that the Patriots drafted receivers who complement each other. Polk is a reliable wideout who is also known for his willingness to block. Baker is a playmaker who can stretch the field. His 21. 9 yards-per-reception average in college was tops among this year's draft prospects. Some experts feel the Patriots reached when they took Robinson at the start of the fourth round, but I'm not one of them. Similarly, there also some people criticizing the Patriots' decision to select Polk instead of some other wideouts who were still on the board. Whether or not these were in fact reaches will ultimately be determined in the next few years. That sprung them to trade up on Day 2 to add McConkey. When healthy, he's one of the top receivers in this class and should be a regular target for Justin Herbert. Health was a factor during his days at Georgia, however, which is worth monitoring at the next level. Best pick (A+): WR Malik Washington, Virginia (Round 6, Pick 184) Electric, short not small wideout who was the heartbeat of the Virginia offense after transferring from Northwestern. Wins underneath with explosion and powerful lower half gives him high-end contact balance. Won't be huge separator on full route tree. Leaper who can find it in the air. Good, not great speed. Niche type but a lot of fun..\n\nQuestion: Who are the two wide receivers drafted by this NFL team?\nAnswers:\nA. Polk and Robinson\nB. Robinson and Polk\nC. Polk and Baker\nD. Baker and Robinson\nE.

They clearly had shortcomings on offense, so they went hard on that side of the ball. While we don\u2019t know how any of these guys will do when it comes to making the transition, it\u2019s hard to fault their overall approach. They had to come out of the draft with a quarterback, and at No. 3, Maye was the best available option. The two receivers should be in the mix early for the reasons mentioned above, and Caedan Wallace almost certainly will be a part of the conversation at offensive tackle. Not incredibly fast nor length with size. Awesome tackling reliability. Routinely finds and makes plays on the football underneath and at intermediate level. Has plus long speed.

Gregory Shamus/Getty Images It remains to be seen how it will translate to the actual field, but the Arizona Cardinals, Washington Commanders and Pittsburgh Steelers can all take solace in one thing. One of the most notable people in NFL media believe they won the 2024 draft. NFL Network's discussed the draft on Monday and said the Cardinals, Commanders and Steelers all had the best drafts based on his big board: Arizona landed arguably the best player in all of college football last season in wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. with the No. 4 overall pick. B/R's NFL Scouting Department ranked him as the top overall player on its latest big board, and he figures to be the No. 1 wide receiver as soon as his rookie season for the Cardinals. What are your thoughts on Ja\u2019Lynn Polk and Javon Baker? Very explosive receivers, but are they going to see action at the start of the season? The draft is done, and we\u2019re back to the Patriots mailbag. Lots of questions about the new faces, some old faces, and where the franchise goes from here. Let\u2019s get to it. I like Polk; his college tape suggests he\u2019s smart, dependable, and good when it comes to 50-50 balls. In addition, his size and pedigree suggest he can contribute at the NFL level relatively quickly. (I would love to see some special teams experience on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but you can\u2019t have everything. ) If it all works out this year, he\u2019s a complementary piece of the passing game who can catch somewhere in the range of 50 passes. That sprung them to trade up on Day 2 to add McConkey. When healthy, he's one of the top receivers in this class and should be a regular target for Justin Herbert. Health was a factor during his days at Georgia, however, which is worth monitoring at the next level.

Prior to her professional career in the WNBA, Parker played for legendary women\u2019s college basketball coach Pat Summitt at the University of Tennessee, where she helped lead the Volunteers to winning back-to-back NCAA Championships in 2007 and 2008. \u201cShe\u2019s a trailblazer. Just a wonderful human being and what she\u2019s done for this sport,\u201d Brondello said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s celebrated. I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for her. Our kids grew up together when I was coaching in Russia. It\u2019s kind of sad. Everyone knows when it\u2019s the right time. \u201d Parker began working in broadcasting during her playing career. She has worked as an analyst for the NCAA Tournament with CBS Sports and for NBA TV. She had surgery on her foot in July 2023 and told the AP it still pained her at the end of last year. \u201cThis offseason hasn\u2019t been fun on a foot that isn\u2019t cooperating,\u201d she wrote in her post Sunday. \u201cMy mission in life, like Pat Summitt always said, is to \u2018chase people and passions and you will never fail.

She finishes her career ninth in total career points with 6,574, third in rebounds with 3,467, and eighth in assists with 1,567. Unfortunately for Parker, she had to deal with multiple injuries that kept her off the court in her career. This included undergoing surgery last July during the middle of the WNBA season to fix a foot fracture. She underwent ten surgeries throughout her career, yet still managed to consistently be one of the best in the game.

Kayla Thornton is a great sixth player, but beyond that Kennedy Burke is the only player with more than one year of experience.

Saturday was prescription drug take-back day, a national event attempting to tackle drug addiction. With prescription pills being the leading cause of overdose deaths, and Oklahoma having some of the highest total number of overdose deaths in the country, Saturday's Prescription Drug Take-Back event was imperative. \"This is our DEA prescription drug take-back event,\" said Damon Morris, an Environmental Compliance Specialist with the City of Tulsa. A bi-annual event hosted by the Drug Enforcement Administration on the last week of April and October with local efforts spear-headed by the Coalition Against Prescription and Substance Abuse of Tulsa. The goal is to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of disposing of prescription drugs, while also educating the public about the potential for abuse of medications. \"There are 12 different locations,\" said Morris. Morris said these efforts are essential. However, director Taylor Hackford\u2019s Ray is still a standout for the genre, in particular for the breathtaking, Academy Award-winning lead performance by Jamie Foxx, whose own real musical talents certainly came in handy when portraying the singer and pianist.

Sid And Nancy Much like the doomed couple on which it is based, Alex Cox\u2019s Sid and Nancy is an explosive, abrasive, drug-fueled exploration of one of punk rock\u2019s earliest icons and the woman to which he will be forever tied. Starring Gary Oldman as Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and Chloe Webb as his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, this 1986 cult classic accomplishes a lot in a short amount of time.

Purple Rain For many, Purple Rain is the musical film. And, while we\u2019re reluctant to call it the greatest rock movie of all time, we definitely understand the sentiment. The story of a young musician named The Kid (played by Prince himself), Purple Rain is part drama, part rock opera, and quite possibly the crowning achievement in Prince\u2019s fantastic career. What truly makes this movie is its titular soundtrack, which just may be the greatest album of the 1980s (And yes, we\u2019re aware that Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller also came out in the \u201880s. We said what we said!). And look, the soundtrack must be phenomenal since the plot itself is a little uneven..\n\nQuestion: Who played the role of the young musician named this Musician in the film Purple Rain?\nAnswers:\nA.

Specifically, he helmed \u201cHoneydew,\u201d which is mostly set in Copenhagen.

He loves it, and he wanted to go to the locker room and be a part of it and just meet some of the players. \u201d Reynolds then told the camera: \u201cHe just keeps shooting it, he\u2019s paying for it. I mean, I\u2019m making Wolverine 10!\u201d McElhenney created and starred in the American sitcom Always Sunny in Philidelphia in 2005, which he continues to make, while Reynolds has starred in the Wolverine franchise since 2009 and is preparing for the forthcoming July release of Deadpool and Wolverine. Wrexham co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney celebrate with players of Wrexham Men and Women during a Wrexham FC Bus Parade (Getty Images) The Always Sunny star concluded that the pair of them had \u201czero dignity\u201d in comparison to footballers. \u201cThese players, they know when it\u2019s time and they walk off with dignity. We have zero dignity,\u201d he said. The Internet has already been re-cutting the first Deadpool & Wolverine trailer to feature the cowl; at this point, it might be in Marvel Studios' interest to just reveal at least one image of the official thing. What Is Deadpool & Wolverine About? The trailer and early synopsis for Deadpool & Wolverine have teased the story of Wade Wilson (Reynolds) being detained by the TVA and sent on a mission. Wade recruits an emotionally-broken Wolverine variant from a dark timeline where the X-Men died, and their mission takes them to the multiversal wasteland the TVA has been using as a dumping ground, and where the beast Alioth (as seen in Loki) roams. Somewhere in that mix is Cassandra Nova (Emma Corin), a villain with deep ties to Charles Xavier, and a malevolent history in X-Men comics. Michael B. Jordan's latest Deadpool & Wolverine post has Marvel fans absolutely scattering. On social media, the Killmonger actor reposted the trailer for the upcoming MCU movie. Of course, people online are putting two and two together. Jordan was The Human Torch in Fant4stic years ago. With Deadpool & Wolverine poised to bring some former Marvel actors back into the fold, could we see his Torch join Elektra, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and more? Well, the chances are better than zero. Especially, if that repost ends up being a clue of some sort\u2026 With appearances in Black Panther, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and What If\u2026?, Michael B. Jordan hasn't exactly slowed up on the superhero roles. Back when he was cast in Ryan Coogler's massive movie, he sounded excited to get back into the ring with the genre. Those at the crossroads between entertainment and sports wonder if the pair will bring a docu-series similar to Welcome to Wrexham for the Mexican soccer club. With Reynolds and McElhenney signing on, it promotes the importance of media deals and pop culture leverage for success. Based in Aguascalientes in northern-central Mexico, its is also unclear how big R. R. McReynolds' stake is. In this day and age, soccer within North America is growing exponentially. It was recently reported that Liga MX is the most-watched soccer league in the U. S. by a wide margin, even surpassing the MLS, La Liga and English Premier League. I won\u2019t lie, if there\u2019s absolutely no chance of ever seeing Josh Brolin as Cable again, I hope it\u2019s that last option purely for comedy\u2019s sake. Feel free to stream Deadpool 2 now with your Disney+ subscription, and stick around the streaming service if you\u2019re looking to view a project containing a different version of Cable, as X-Men \u201997 Season 1 is still running on the 2024 TV schedule. Meanwhile, Deadpool and Wolverine opens July 26 as one of this summer\u2019s biggest 2024 movie releases. (Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images) Getty Images Despite his stake in the team and the business it entails, Reynolds is a fan of the Red Dragons. \u201cI mean, I'm starstruck by the players. We follow them so closely, and we do have a pretty, I would say, indelible connection to the players, the staff around the club, even the groundskeepers that work at the stadiums to so meticulously create the best-looking grass on Earth,\u201d Ryan stated. \u201cWe are fans as well as somehow, in a satellite way, part of the story. \u201d \u201cYou watch these guys. We watched every single game. And you just can't help it,\u201d offered Rob regarding the organic fandom the co-owners have experienced. \" He'd add, \"No I mean, I did Stryker, and then they did it again in Australia, and my friend Danny Huston played Stryker. Danny\u2019s an old friend of mine so I, don\u2019t feel any. but I kept thinking why did they not ask me. When these things finish, I tend to let go of them. I don\u2019t dwell on anything.

Insiders speculate that the Church of Scientology's labeling of Kidman as a \"suppressive person\" after her departure from the church may be a factor in the strained relations. This designation, meant to denote someone who is a negative influence on church members, allegedly leads to enforced disconnections from loved ones who leave the fold. Meanwhile, Kidman's family life with Urban and their daughters paints a starkly different picture-one of unity and public appearances. Last night marked a significant family milestone as it was the first time Sunday and Faith joined their mother on the red carpet, a moment Kidman cherished deeply.

(Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) DETROIT \u2013 Another NFL Draft has come and gone, and the Detroit Lions added six new players to what was already a Super Bowl-caliber roster. Here are my final thoughts on what Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell pulled off across all three days. Doubling up on cornerbacks Holmes has always been a big-time believer in taking the best player available when it\u2019s his turn to pick. Fortunately for the Lions, the best player available also happened to fill a need their first two times on the clock. The Green Bay Packers made 11 selections in the 2024 NFL draft, starting with offensive lineman Jordan Morgan at No. 25 overall in the first round and ending with cornerback Kalen King at No. 255 overall in the seventh round. It\u2019s time to break down the class. Best picks. Sleepers. Winners. Losers. Strategy. Let\u2019s dig in. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Packers\u2019 draft class in 2024:. The Dallas Cowboys didn\u2019t do much in free agency this offseason, but here they are with an actual offseason roster. Following the 2024 draft, the team has somewhat plugged all of their holes that were left after seeing a handful of starters leave in free agency and not doing much to replace them on the veteran market. Dallas drafted eight players and then signed additional collegiate players in undrafted free agency. As of now, the Cowboys still have three remaining slots on their 90-man roster. Rookie minicamp kicks off in about two weeks and they likely are holding spots for some of their tryout invites to see if they can make it to the rest of the offseason schedule. Here\u2019s a look at the breakdown, position-by-position, of the 87 players they have in the fold now, along with our projection of the current pecking order. Latest Lone Wolves podcast breaks down each of the Lions six picks. The Detroit Lions are drawing rave reviews for their six selections in the 2024 NFL Draft. Brad Holmes was able to drastically upgrade the secondary with the selections of Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. With the state of the roster being stable, Detroit's personnel department was even able to take chances on players that can develop over the next couple of seasons. Since 2021, the Lions have been able to take chances on draft picks because the active roster has solid starters and depth at multiple positions. With the secondary needing an overhaul, Holmes and Co. went about adding multiple defensive backs in free agency and in the draft. Detroit's fourth-year general manager even drew comparisons to Eagles general manager Howie Roseman by Sports Illustrated. The Arizona Cardinals, with 12 player selections in the 2024 NFL draft, brought their offseason roster to 88 players. That left room for only two other players. They announced the signing of three undrafted rookies and one release. They released long snapper Matt Hembrough, signed as an undrafted rookie last year out of Oklahoma State. He spent the year on injured reserve. He was released because they added a long snapper among their rookie free agents. Their three undrafted rookie signings are: Defensive lineman Myles Murphy, North Carolina Long snapper Joe Shimko, N. C. State Receiver Xavier Weaver, Colorado Murphy is 6-foot-4 and 309 pounds. He played four seasons for the Tar Heels and had seven career sacks and 17 career tackles for loss. Shimko played five seasons for N. C. The ultimate goal for every NFL roster is to improve before Week 1. It comes in free agency. It comes with trades. It\u2019s finalized with the draft over three days and 150-plus picks. Maybe the Houston Texans aren\u2019t ready to land at the top of all Super Bowl odds, but DeMeco Ryans believes his roster is trending upward heading into Year 2. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about all the guys we brought in,\u201d Ryans said Saturday after the final pick of the 2024 NFL draft. \u201cWe feel like all these guys are quality players that add to the depth, add to the competition of our team. \u201d The Texans secured nine players over two days and five rounds. While without a first-round pick, it likely didn\u2019t matter given the selection was used eventually to acquire Pro Bowl receiver Stefon Diggs..\n\nQuestion: How many players did this NFL team add to their roster during the 2024 NFL draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

Doubling up on cornerbacks Holmes has always been a big-time believer in taking the best player available when it\u2019s his turn to pick. Fortunately for the Lions, the best player available also happened to fill a need their first two times on the clock. Detroit stayed put at No. 61 and selected Missouri cornerback Ennis Rakestraw Jr. , a top-40 prospect on nearly every board. Rakestraw isn\u2019t as polished as Arnold, but he gives the Lions another option and turns what was a clear weakness one week ago into a unit with some quality depth. End of Taylor Decker era? With the departure of Jonah Jackson in free agency, guard was obviously a need for the Lions. Even though they signed veteran guards Graham Glasgow and Kevin Zeitler to hold down the starting spots this season, the near future comes with major questions. But when the Lions turned their attention to the offensive line on Saturday, it was a tackle, not a guard, who first joined the Honolulu Blue. Washington's most notable pick was quarterback Jayden Daniels at No. 2 overall. Daniels won the 2023 Heisman Trophy at LSU and will likely start in his rookie season as the NFC East team begins a new era. And Pittsburgh bolstered its offensive line with guard Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier in the first two rounds before landing a potential steal in Michigan wide receiver Roman Wilson in the third round. Grading each of the New York Jets' seven draft picks highlighted by Penn State OT Olu Fashanu and Western Kentucky WR Malachi Corley. The New York Jets addressed multiple perceived needs in the 2024 NFL Draft, but only time will tell if general manager Joe Douglas made the proper picks. The Jets added seven players over the three-day draft and I've graded each pick individually. Here are my day-after reactions to the Jets' draft haul. Pick 1 (R1 - No. 11 overall) Olu Fashanu, OT, Penn State Grade: B- The Jets traded down one spot and still landed one of the top-tier offensive tackle prospects. There is definitely a need for insurance behind two 33-year-old starting offensive tackles, but one could argue the team would benefit more from a slam dunk plug-and-play pass-catcher. The highly anticipated 2024 NFL draft is over and teams can turn their attention to the season ahead. The Miami Dolphins made seven picks in this draft and were able to add new players to fill many of their team needs. Of course, not every position can be addressed in the draft. There were a few position groups the Dolphins chose not to add to in the draft even though they jumped out as areas that needed help. The question of best available player against team need is a decision every team has to make several times throughout the draft. Here is a list of six position the Dolphins did not address in the 2024 NFL draft:. The New England Patriots made some noise in the fourth round of the NFL draft by using a pick they got in a trade with the Los Angeles Chargers on former UCF star receiver Javon Baker. After failing to land a true No. 1 veteran receiving target, the Patriots set their eyes on the draft to upgrade the skilled positions around their new rookie quarterback, Drake Maye. Baker is an explosive playmaker capable of working both outside and inside. He\u2019s also tremendous in contested catch situations. Just one look at his highlight reel is enough to see why some are so excited about his potential. Baker\u2019s confidence is unrivaled, and he plays with a level of chippiness that is uncommon in New England. They addressed that problem by drafting some experts\u2019 CB1 in Arnold in the first round, then using their second-round pick to snag another corner. From there they added some offensive line depth, and Vaki, one of the most intriguing prospects in the draft because he played both sides of the ball for the Utes last year. They get extra points for leapfrogging the Packers in the draft to select Arnold, who many expected to be a target for Green Bay. If there\u2019s a knock on Detroit's draft class it\u2019s that they didn\u2019t come away with a pass catcher to join Amon-Ra St. Brown, Sam LaPorta and Jameson Williams.

The Detroit Lions are drawing rave reviews for their six selections in the 2024 NFL Draft. Brad Holmes was able to drastically upgrade the secondary with the selections of Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. With the state of the roster being stable, Detroit's personnel department was even able to take chances on players that can develop over the next couple of seasons. Since 2021, the Lions have been able to take chances on draft picks because the active roster has solid starters and depth at multiple positions. With the secondary needing an overhaul, Holmes and Co. went about adding multiple defensive backs in free agency and in the draft. Detroit's fourth-year general manager even drew comparisons to Eagles general manager Howie Roseman by Sports Illustrated. Both first-round edge Laiatu Latu and second-round WR Adonai Mitchell came with red flags. Both could be huge hits for GM Chris Ballard, or go the other way. Regardless, these are swings for the fences such as the selection of Anthony Richardson a year ago. \u2022 Sometimes you hear stuff leading up to the draft that winds up coming true on Thursday night\u2014and such was the case with the Jacksonville Jaguars, who did a ton of work on the receivers over the past two months. It matches, too, with how far they were willing to go to keep Calvin Ridley, even with contracts for Christian Kirk and Gabe Davis on the ledger. So they\u2019re committed to improving the skill-position talent around Trevor Lawrence. Now they just have to hope Brian Thomas Jr..\n\nQuestion: What positions did this NFL team focus on during the NFL Draft?\nAnswers:\nA. Quarterbacks\nB. Wide receivers\nC. Linebackers\nD.

Thornton/Getty) Caleb Williams arrives at the 2024 NFL draft on April 25, 2024 in Detroit. \u2022 Even without a new quarterback, you can\u2019t accuse New York Giants GM Joe Schoen of not swinging for the fences. Given some of the noise at the end of the year, and the franchise\u2019s history with mercurial receivers, it\u2019d be understandable if Schoen opted for Rome Odunze, as clean a prospect as you\u2019ll find, at No. 6. Instead, they went for LSU\u2019s Malik Nabers, who\u2019s got a little injury baggage, and a rep for being a little hard to handle. If the Giants hit? Well, I\u2019ve heard comps to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. \u2022 A lot of people figured the New York Jets would take a weapon for Aaron Rodgers, which is why Bowers was projected there. ESPN\u2019s Jordan Reid pegged Suamataia\u2019s selection as his favorite pick of the draft, citing Kansas City\u2019s ability to trust young offensive linemen to perform well early in their careers. \u201cI\u2019m going with an under-the-radar move here. In the aforementioned deep offensive tackle class, Suamataia got a bit lost in the shuffle. But he ultimately landed in the perfect spot in Kansas City,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThe Chiefs have a huge need at left tackle, and they don\u2019t shy away from playing offensive linemen early; they saw near-immediate success from Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith on the interior. So, Suamataia has the potential to contribute as a rookie. He has exciting traits, including lower-half suddenness, and certainly could develop into a dependable starter. He also will have to adapt to the unique pressure, expectations and critical noise in Chicago. And he must quickly become the energy source in the Bears locker room, serving as the team leader through all the inevitable highs and lows. Williams already seems to understand those dynamics and responsibilities and is ready to lean into all of it. Bears quarterback Caleb Williams speaks at Halas Hall in on April 26, 2024.

Advertisement Flores\u2019 father, Luis Antonio Flores, launched Cowboys Nation Mx, a social media platform devoted to providing news, videos, photographs, analysis and commentary for the franchise\u2019s fans in Mexico. When his father died, Eduardo took over the operation. \u201cWhen my dad left, part of me went with him,\u201d Flores said. \u201cI was left with nobody to talk about the Cowboys. \u201d Thomas was the 233rd overall pick. Washington's most notable pick was quarterback Jayden Daniels at No. 2 overall. Daniels won the 2023 Heisman Trophy at LSU and will likely start in his rookie season as the NFC East team begins a new era. And Pittsburgh bolstered its offensive line with guard Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier in the first two rounds before landing a potential steal in Michigan wide receiver Roman Wilson in the third round. If growing pains do come around, it happens with a lot of players. You deal with it in that moment. You handle it. But I don't think about it. \" Williams will start from step one, just like he did at USC in 2022. People doubted him then, saying it would be a rebuilding year for USC and that their chances of making the College Football Playoff were dim. Instead, Williams and his team shocked the college football world, recording an 11-1 record and being one win shy of making the College Football Playoff. The former All-American will look to shock the football world once again and lead the Bears to new heights right out of the gate. It won't be easy, but Williams was selected No. 1 overall to do the impossible. Vikings DC Brian Flores might be the man to make the most of Turner\u2019s talents as one of the most creative pass rush designers in the league. Further, the team added a new reliable kicker in Reichard, who just set the record for most points scored in FBS history.

Griner blamed a \"mental lapse\" for having the cartridges in her luggage and flying to a country where marijuana and medical cannabis are still against the law. She was imprisoned from February to December before she was a part of a prisoner swap for arms dealer Viktor Bout. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS. COM The WNBA star talked to Robin Roberts about her detention on ABC\u2019s \"Good Morning America. \" A snippet of the interview aired Monday, with the full segment being released Wednesday. Roberts asked Griner what she had to say to the skeptics who could not believe she had simply forgotten she had the cartridges on her. Ultimately, he said he wanted to 'take ownership' of what he did and pleaded fans not to defend him or his actions. 'It's on me to take ownership for this and I fully accept any penalties I'm facing. The time of my return is solely on me and the work I put in,' he concluded. In April, 2021, Wallen, who is now signed to Warner Chappell Music, donated $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition in the names of 20 people who had counseled him after he used the racial slur. Wallen publicly spoke of his comments on Good Morning America on July 23, where he said that 'he was around some of his friends, and they say dumb stuff together' and said that 'he was wrong' to express those words. ' He went on to say that he 'understands' SNL's decision, but that he is 'NOT positive for COVID. ' The singer admitted that his 'actions this past weekend were shortsighted' and that they have now affected his 'long-term goals and [his] dreams. ' 'I respect the show's decision because I know that I put them in jeopardy, and I take ownership for this. I'd like to apologize to SNL, to my fans, to my team for bringing me these opportunities, and I let them down\u2026 I think have growing up to do.

The chart-topping 28-year-old musician brought out a few big-name artists to join him on stage for a unique set at Stagecoach on Saturday night. By all accounts, it was a big hit! Posty seemingly knows everybody in music at this point in his career. He was recently featured on Beyonce\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 album and Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018The Tortured Poets Department\u2019 after performing with Morgan Wallen and Hardy at the CMA Awards back in November. Even though those four artists did not appear at the Empire Polo Club despite some rumblings, the star power was still there! At this point in his career, Post Malone has not officially released any country songs of his own. Thus, his set was made up entirely of covers. Tyler Childers was on the set list. As was George Strait. Post Malone performed a special set of covers for the second night of Stagecoach 2024, the country music fest that takes place the weekend after Coachella on the same Empire Polo Club grounds. Prior to the show, Post Malone gave out a phone number where one could text their requests as to what he covered. He had some special guests: Brad Paisley came out to sing along with his own \u201cI\u201dm Gonna Miss Her,\u201d and helped out on covers of Vince Gill\u2019s \u201cOne More Last Chance\u201d and Alan Jackson\u2019s \u201cChattahoochee. \u201d Dwight Yoakam sang his own \u201cLittle Ways\u201d with Post Malone, and Sara Evans joined Post for \u201cSuds In The Bucket. \u201d There were also covers by Tim McGraw, Toby Keith, Tyler Childers, George Strait, John Michael Montgomery, and Randy Travis on the setlist. Check out some video from the night below.

Getty Image Post Malone has officially gone country! The chart-topping 28-year-old musician brought out a few big-name artists to join him on stage for a unique set at Stagecoach on Saturday night. By all accounts, it was a big hit! Posty seemingly knows everybody in music at this point in his career. He was recently featured on Beyonce\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 album and Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018The Tortured Poets Department\u2019 after performing with Morgan Wallen and Hardy at the CMA Awards back in November. Even though those four artists did not appear at the Empire Polo Club despite some rumblings, the star power was still there! At this point in his career, Post Malone has not officially released any country songs of his own. Thus, his set was made up entirely of covers. Tyler Childers was on the set list. As was George Strait. I don't know if I could have unlocked the musicality in my paintings in a real way without it. Hear the sonata below: Read the original article on Business Insider. You can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains. Country music legend Dwight Yoakam was the first artist to be introduced. The Rhinestone Cowboy and Posty sang \u2018Little Ways\u2019 early in the set. Two songs later, Brad Paisley came out to duet his hit \u2018I\u2019m Gonna Miss Her,\u2019 which Post Malone had actually covered once before! They also sang Alan Jackson\u2019s smash hit \u2018Chattahoochee. \u2019 Sara Evans was the third guest to make an appearance. The Indio winds were whipping through her hair while they performed \u2018Suds in the Bucket. \u2019. For the sold-out crowd, there was unanimous agreement. The pair were handed another red solo cup filled to the rim with beer, cheering as they set off to play \u201cOne More Last Chance\u201d by Vince Gill. Sara Evans eventually appeared on stage for \u201cSuds in the Bucket\u201d and fully showed off her vocals by standing in the back with no mic needed. Malone\u2019s set was a heartfelt homage to country greats past and present. In a poignant moment, he spoke about fatherhood, reflecting on how \u201cthese days, it just hits a bit harder,\u201d especially now that his daughter is two years old. As the instrumentals of Tim McGraw\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Take The Girl\u201d began to play, the sentimentality of the moment resonated throughout the crowd. Paisley returned for Malone\u2019s final cover of \u201cChattahoochee\u201d by Alan Jackson. Two songs later, previous Stagecoach headliner Brad Paisley was on stage to duet on his hit \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Miss Her\u201d and stayed on stage for the pair to cover Vince Gill\u2019s \u201cOne More Last Chance. \u201d Later, Sara Evans joined Malone, her long brown hair whipping in the gusty Indio wind, for her hit \u201cSuds in the Bucket. \u201d Paisley returned to play guitar on the final song of the set, a rollicking cover of the Alan Jackson classic \u201cChattahoochee. \u201d However, despite the rumors, and the plane flying the \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d banner around the polo fields earlier in the evening, Beyonc\u00e9 didn\u2019t hop on stage..\n\nQuestion: What genre did this Musician perform at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival?\nAnswers:\nA.

It\u2019s not far-fetched for Malone to venture into country territory. The rapper recently teased a new release with fellow Stagecoach headliner Morgan Wallen on social media and a major guest spot on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d on \u201cLevii\u2019s Jeans. \u201d All in all, it makes sense. , on Saturday, April 27, 2024.

Taking to the par-71 layout for the fourth time in tournament history, players should expect ideal scoring conditions and plenty of birdies with a winning score potentially approaching 30 under. Last year, it was Jason Day who emerged victorious as the Australian jumped back into the winner's circle for the first time in over five years. Now, he hopes to become the first golfer since K. H. Lee in 2022 to defend his Byron Nelson title Day leads a large international contingent which includes Adam Scott, Min Woo Lee, Sungjae Im and a couple of Dallas-area residents in Tom Kim and Si Woo Kim. He will defend his title June 20-23. As one of the PGA Tour\u2019s Signature events, the Travelers will, for the first time, host 70 to 80 of the top players this year with no midway cut. Among the players committed to playing are world No. 1 Scottie Sheffler, No. 2 Rory McIlroy, No. 4 Ludvig Aberg, No. 8 Patrick Cantlay and No. 13 Collin Morikawa. For any of them, though, a victory can\u2019t possibly mean what it did for Bradley, who remembered standing next to the club\u2019s old driving range as a young fan. \u201cI waited outside there for David Duval to come out, and I watched him warm up and I watched all 18 holes,\u201d Bradley remembered. \u201cIt was such a dream. I knew this is what I wanted to do. \u201d. In his last seven starts, Spieth has one top 10, three missed cuts and a disqualification. He needs to find something in his game and fast. Si Woo Kim (16-1) Jason Day (20-1): The defending champion has been hit-or-miss since claiming his second Byron Nelson crown. While he has a number of quality results over the last year, Day has struggled with some consistency and arrives at TPC Craig Ranch looking to find something in his iron play specifically. The former world No. 1 has lost strokes on approach in four of his last five starts but has been buoyed by a strong effort from the putter. If he hopes to keep up in this birdie barrage, Day will need to squeeze more out of those scoring clubs. The defending champion has been hit-or-miss since claiming his second Byron Nelson crown.

Thursday, they selected Oregon quarterback Bo Nix in the first round of the NFL draft (12th overall), and sources said the Broncos have informed Wilson and his representatives that they will not pick up the fifth-year option in Wilson's contract. As the No. 2 pick of the 2021 draft by the New York Jets, Wilson's rookie deal included a fifth-year option for the 2025 season. The option would have been for a guaranteed $22. 408 million. As expected, the Broncos won\u2019t be committing to Zach Wilson for the 2025 campaign. According to ESPN\u2019s Jeff Legwold, the Broncos have informed Wilson\u2019s camp that they won\u2019t be picking up the quarterback\u2019s fifth-year option. Considering the $22. 41M commitment that the option would have required, it\u2019s not a surprise that the Broncos won\u2019t lock themselves into that salary. Wilson will now hit free agency following the 2024 campaign, and he\u2019s set to earn more than $5M in what will be the final season of his rookie contract. (The Jets are picking up a portion of that tab. ) The Broncos acquired the former second overall pick last week, swapping a sixth-round pick for a seventh-round pick along the way. Things have already changed since that acquisition, as the Broncos reached a bit for Bo Nix in the first round. The Denver Broncos picked up cornerback Pat Surtain\u2019s fifth-year option for the 2025 season last week, but the team will not exercise quarterback Zach Wilson\u2019s fifth-year option before the May 2 deadline, according to the Denver Gazette\u2018s Chris Tomasson. This, of course, is no surprise because the cost of the option for a quarterback like Wilson would be $22. 4 million in 2025. The Broncos will pay him just $2. 72 million this fall after agreeing to split his remaining salary with the Jets. Surtain and Wilson were eligible for fifth-year options because they were first-round picks in the 2021 NFL draft. Surtain is now under contract for the next two years, and Denver will presumably work on getting him a long-term extension. Wilson is set to spend the 2024 season with the Broncos before becoming an unrestricted free agent in 2025. New York Jets quarterback Zach Wilson (2) during a press conference after an NFL football game between the New York Jets and the Atlanta Falcons at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium in London, England, Sunday, Oct. 10, 2021. Atlanta Falcons won the match 27-20. Former BYU Cougars quarterback Zach Wilson got a fresh NFL start last week when he was traded by the New York Jets to the Denver Broncos, but his future isn\u2019t exactly settled. On Tuesday evening, ESPN\u2019s Jeff Legwold reported that, according to his sources, the Broncos will not pick up the fifth-year option on Wilson\u2019s contract. What does that mean? As a first-round draft pick, the deal Wilson signed with the Jets after he was drafted included four years plus a team option for a fifth year. As expected, the Broncos won\u2019t be committing to Zach Wilson for the 2025 campaign. According to ESPN\u2019s Jeff Legwold, the Broncos have informed Wilson\u2019s camp that they won\u2019t be picking up the quarterback\u2019s fifth-year option.

Megan Briggs/Getty Images In a move that won't surprise anyone, the Denver Broncos will decline to pick up the fifth-year option on the contract of quarterback Zach Wilson before Thursday's deadline after acquiring him from the New York Jets earlier this month, per Chris Tomasson of the Denver Gazette. The option would've been worth $22. 4 million for the 2025 season. Wilson will now be scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent after the 2024 campaign, giving him a chance to explore the open market. The Broncos sent a sixth-round pick (No. 203) in the 2024 NFL draft to the Jets in exchange for Wilson and a seventh-round pick (No. 256).

In addition, the following players have received an invite to Patriots\u2019 rookie minicamp: kicker Vince Blanchard (Laval), cornerback Trajan Bandy (Miami), offensive tackle Tairiq Stewart (North Carolina A&T), and defensive back John Davis Jr. (North Texas). The difference between a rookie minicamp invite and a UDFA signing is that the free agents have already signed a deal with the team, while the invite is a tryout with no signed contract between the player and the franchise.

CB Kaleb Ford-Dement, Texas State: The 5-foot-11, 190-pound Ford-Dement started 11 of a possible 13 games last year, and came away with three interceptions and seven pass breakups. Ford-Dement was stingy in coverage this past season for the Bobcats; according to PFF, he was the sixth-best corner in the Sun Belt in passer rating against. But his quickness could very well end up being his calling card, as he posted a 4. 49 in the 40-yard dash and a 6. 8 three-cone time. You can\u2019t teach speed. TE Jacob Warren, Tennessee: Will Tennessee be the new Rutgers? That remains to be seen, but Warren\u2019s intangibles are awfully impressive. A three-year starter who was named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll a record five times, the teammate of sixth-round pick Joe Milton ended his college career with 53 catches for 607 yards and eight touchdowns. \"It just brings a whole lot of confidence to the group, whether it\u2019s a blocked shot that gets the bench up, whether it\u2019s a big save or even just a couple good clears. \" Vancouver's penalty kill operated at 92. 3 per cent over the first three post-season games and has weathered 12 straight infractions without conceding a goal. \u201cI think the PK all year has been a resilient group. We\u2019ve had some stretches where we\u2019ve had a bad run with a bunch of 5-on-3s and it looks bad, but I think overall, it\u2019s been pretty good,\" said Canucks head coach Rick Tocchet. Vancouver killed five penalties Friday en route to a 2-1 win over the host Predators and a lead in the series. After not scoring in any of his first 32 appearances for Manchester City in all competitions, Josko Gvardiol has since scored three goals in his past five appearances for the club. \u201d Defense and fundamentals as a whole were focal points of the offseason. The team started well in that department but has had some bumps recently \u2014 whether it\u2019s not hitting cutoffs or executing other plays. \u201cWith some of the injuries, that affected who we had to play at certain positions,\u201d Getz said. \u201cThose are things you have to take into account. But when they all come at once, it can be a little more difficult. We\u2019ve got some players that have really improved defensively and have been consistent for us at getting outs and creating outs. \u201cAre there areas that need to get better? Sure. But overall, I\u2019ve been fairly happy with our defense. It\u2019s a huge piece of our success at this level. We\u2019ve got players that are very capable.

The Hatters' ground was added to EA Sports FC 24 in April [EA] A video developer says recreating Luton Town's stadium for a best-selling computer game was a \"great challenge\" given that the real-life version is surrounded by closely-packed terraced housing. Fab Muoio is an art director in a team of more than 200 people at Electronic Arts Vancouver, where they develop EA FC 24, which now includes a virtual Kenilworth Road. He said: \"I think the shape of it and the size, compared to some of our larger stadiums - it's a bit on the smaller side. \"Just looking at the row of houses close by and ensuring it works with our gameplay cameras and there's no issues there when it comes to play-ability.

I realise the fact that it\u2019s actually a good series has helped with this, with many people watching it who have no idea what the game is, but judging by the sales and player numbers recently many have been inspired to go out and find out more about it. All of the Bethesda games have been cheap or free for the last few weeks and Fallout 4 has become the best-selling game of the month, which is incredible for a nine-year-old game that has never really been thought of as that big of a seller before.

Go behind a dribble handoff or ball screen, and he\u2019s pulling it. He shot more 3s (189) than 2s (102). He\u2019s been well-schooled in how to play efficient basketball, hunting 3s and being willing to make the extra pass if the shot isn\u2019t there for him. He made eight 3s in the Sweet 16 game against North Carolina and then followed that up with eight assists in the Elite Eight against Clemson. This is a surprising one because he\u2019s such a good fit in Alabama\u2019s system and started 33 games this season. \u2014 C. J.

He can overpower perimeter players, and if you put a bigger guy on him, he can face up and drive to the basket. He\u2019s clearly put in the work to make himself a shooter. He shot just 22. 8 percent from 3 in two seasons at Louisville and has been a 36. 8 percent 3-point shooter the last two years at Seton Hall. He does most of his scoring in the paint, but he\u2019s capable of stepping out and knocking down a jumper. 8 points and 3. 8 assists per game. Rice can pass, but his tendency right now is to get downhill and be a scorer. He plays at his own pace, utilizing hang dribbles to keep himself alive. From there, everything is available to him at all three levels. He\u2019s extremely comfortable pulling up from midrange and from 3, although his shooting percentages in both areas were quite poor. Rice thrives when he can get all the way to the rim, where his 62 percent mark (per Synergy) was very strong for a high-major guard. He also showed some ability to play off the ball. Rice only hit 27. 5 percent of his 3s this season despite making 81 percent of his foul shots. There\u2019s nothing clearly wrong with the shot, and he has good touch. 3 boards per game. After playing on a balanced scoring team during FAU\u2019s 2023 Final Four run, Davis showed this season he could be a high-usage scorer. He\u2019s good off the catch, and as a righty who prefers to drive left, he also can put the ball on the floor to score at all three levels. He was at his best in big games, averaging 20. 8 points against the six high majors on FAU\u2019s schedule and scoring a season-high 35 points against Arizona. Davis is also a willing passer when he gets downhill. He\u2019s always been turnover-prone, which is partly due to his aggressiveness. He will be a target for high majors looking for a perimeter scorer. The possibility of Davis following coach Dusty May to Michigan is an obvious one. \u2014 C. J.

Haggerty isn\u2019t an elite passer, but he\u2019s a good one. If you blitz him, he\u2019ll find the open man. He reads the court well. Given that he has three years left, I think there is a real case Haggerty is the best player in the portal.

Though Belmont\u2019s offense didn\u2019t feature as many ball screens as other schools\u2019, Gillespie is adept at getting downhill on those actions or when taking a dribble hand-off on the move. He uses the threat of his shot to attack closeouts and is an excellent finisher for a small guard, showing an aptitude for adjusting in mid-air with a variety of touch finger rolls and finishes.

That's a long way of saying the Suns underachieved this season but are largely locked into this roster. They could explore the trade market for Jusuf Nurkic, who will make $18 million next season, but he is the franchise center, and any deal for him would have to include a plan to replace him with next to no salary flexibility.

Durant had a very healthy season, and Booker played 68 games after averaging 63 games over the previous six seasons. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Indiana center Myles Turner found a simple lesson from last week\u2019s Game 1 loss. When you find the openings, take shots without hesitating. Turner effectively put his new strategy to use Sunday night and it worked perfectly, again. He had his second straight 29-point game, finished with nine rebounds and four assists and made seven 3-pointers as the Pacers broke the franchise\u2019s NBA playoff record with 22 3\u2019s to beat Milwaukee 126-113 for a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. \u201cAfter that first game, we watched a lot of film and I saw some of the holes in the defense and realized there were open shots we could exploit,\u201d Turner said. \u201cA lot of it is read and react, which is pretty much what our whole offense is. \u201d Turner\u2019s play over the last two games has changed the series.

Davis appeared to call out Lakers coaches following the Game 2 loss in which the Lakers blew a 20-point lead in Denver. \"We have stretches where we just don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor,\" he said. Ham took exception to the comments, telling reporters he has an \"incredibly talented\" staff that prides itself in being \"highly efficient and organized\" and addressed Davis privately, while publicly rebuffing him. \"I'll agree to disagree on that one,\" Ham said. A team source was confounded by Ham's lack of accountability, questioning to ESPN the merit in boasting about his coaching staff's preparedness while the Nuggets ran their winning streak against them into double digits. Advertisement NBA icon James meanwhile finished with 30 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds to lead the Lakers scoring in what was the final act of his 21st season in the NBA. Afterwards, James declined to be drawn on his future plans, saying he would now spend time with his family before preparing for this summer\u2019s Olympics. Asked if Monday\u2019s defeat may have been his last game for the Lakers, James smiled and replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that. \u201d Lakers defensive stalwart Anthony Davis, who appeared troubled by a shoulder injury for much of the game, had 17 points with 15 rebounds and four assists. \u201cThey\u2019re a hell of a team,\u201d Lakers coach Darvin Ham said of Denver after the defeat. Indiana answered with a 10-2 run to rebuild a 108-94 cushion with 7:25 to play and Turner helped put it away with a couple of late 3-pointers before both teams put their starters on the bench. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize when I hit the 3 they were chanting my name. I saw it afterward,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBut it was very special, knowing how much this city means to me and with my family here, it was very special. \u201d (The Associated Press contributed to this report) Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

It's felt unstable since [Ishbia] arrived. He's a good guy and everything, I think, but he's just very involved. Too involved. I know he played [college basketball], but I'd venture to say he has no idea what he's doing when it comes to basketball. Yet he's making a lot of the big decisions. \" There are rumors about how the Suns are considering firing first-year head coach, Frank Vogel, who was given a broken roster and was expected to win. The Suns are a mess and their first step is to find an identity within their front office. A. believing that the championship window for this core has not closed, and if a different voice is needed to lead the group, the franchise will make the financial commitment to do so. THE LAKERS STUMBLED out of the gates this season with an opening-night loss -- to the champion Nuggets on their ring night -- leading to a 3-5 start. It was enough for Ham to switch around his starting lineup. He benched guard Austin Reaves on Nov. 10, replacing him with Cam Reddish in an attempt to shore up the Lakers' defense. A unit that had been such a staple during its 2023 postseason run was giving up 121. 4 points per game in those early losses and ranked 19th in the league in defensive efficiency through Nov. 8.

(Photo by John Fisher/Getty Images) Getty Images On April 22nd, the Brooklyn Nets hired former Sacramento Kings\u2019 Associate Coach Jordi Fernandez to be the team\u2019s 24th Head Coach in franchise history. Church also spent time as assistant coach at Florida Southern and Saint Joseph\u2019s. A four-year player at Ashland University, Church was named team captain in 2003. Church and wife Jennifer have three children, Harrison, Evelynn and Vincent. He let it be known to the Chargers he was interested. So, when Harbaugh called two months ago, Hardwick answered. Well, at least the second time Harbaugh called he answered. Not recognizing the number, Hardwick didn\u2019t pick up the first time. After receiving a text that Harbaugh was attempting to reach him, Hardwick connected with the new No. 1 Charger. \u201cYou feel it in your heart a little,\u201d Hardwick. \u201c \u2018Oh, God, this is happening.

Phoenix ranked last in the NBA in offensive efficiency in the fourth, a jarring stat considering the team's firepower, and 22nd in defensive efficiency. On average the Suns were getting outscored by about 12 points per 100 fourth-quarter possessions during the regular season. It's where the Suns most felt the loss of floor general Chris Paul, who was the key salary piece traded to acquire Beal. Vogel, naturally, was asked about this repeatedly during the season. (Photo by Jacob Kupferman/Getty Images) Getty Images After basically two \u201call-in\u201d efforts by the Nets in 10-years, the trading of future draft picks has come to haunt them in 2024. Unless a trade comes before this year\u2019s draft, the Nets will not have a single selection in either round. They recently acquired the Suns\u2019 2025 First-Round selection, but in 2026 the Nets currently will not be drafting in the First-Round either. So, with a non-competitive roster rolling into next year without the addition of any drafted talent, the product is not expected to improve under Fernandez\u2019s leadership. But, as backwards as it may sound, this is exactly how it should be. Fernandez\u2019s hiring came after a disappointing regular season, where the Nets finished 32-50 and fired Head Coach Jacque Vaughn after a 21-33 start to the year. The product on the floor did not improve much after Vaughn departed, as Interim HC Kevin Ollie only brought the team to finish the year on an 11-17 mark. While the expectations were low for the Nets entering their first full season without Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, the main objective of the year was to see if they had a player to build the franchise around on the current roster.

They fell just short last year, losing to the Las Vegas Aces in the WNBA Finals. As training camp opened Sunday, New York's starting five from last season was healthy and practicing. That wasn't the case a year ago. \u201cWe know what happened last year and the fact we didn't achieve our goal will motivate us, but it's not what we're thinking about the entire season,\" Breanna Stewart said. \"I'm really excited to get things going with a new and old group and build the chemistry. 2023-24 season: 49-33 Highlight of the season: A mid-January stretch when the team ran off seven straight wins and looked in part like what was promised by ownership. How it ended With brooms. The Suns, led by three offensive juggernauts in Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, failed to win a single game in the opening round of the playoffs, losing four straight to the Minnesota Timberwolves, a team ranked 16th in offense. In what was supposed to be a dynamic offensive season for the Suns, injuries largely kept them from fielding a team of three stars and thus consistency lacked. It didn\u2019t help matters that the organization prioritized top-shelf talent, which with today\u2019s CBA comes at the price of depth. \"We do have times in which adversity hits and we'll kind of just get flat,\" Beal said after the Suns' Game 3 loss Friday. \"Why it happens, I wish I had an answer. \" Another real issue for evaluating Vogel was the outright disaster the Suns were in fourth quarters, a devastating anchor that dragged the team to that No. 6 seed. Phoenix ranked last in the NBA in offensive efficiency in the fourth, a jarring stat considering the team's firepower, and 22nd in defensive efficiency. On average the Suns were getting outscored by about 12 points per 100 fourth-quarter possessions during the regular season. It's where the Suns most felt the loss of floor general Chris Paul, who was the key salary piece traded to acquire Beal. Vogel, naturally, was asked about this repeatedly during the season. A lot of teams have been together for a few years, so I\u2019m looking forward to building. \u201d It's unclear whether head coach Frank Vogel will be returning as well. Shams Charania of Doug Heller of The Athletic reported that the Suns plan \"to take a hard look at making a full coaching change or, at the very least, discuss adjustments to Vogel's staff. \" Charania and Heller added that \"Durant never felt comfortable with his role in Phoenix's offense\" this season, as he felt \"that he was being relegated to the corner far too often and not having the proper designs to play to his strengths, as the offense was built around pick-and-rolls. \" The relevant clip from the segment is below. \u201cFrank Vogel wanted a point guard on that roster, and the front office believed that bringing a point guard over would take the ball out of the hands of Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant\u2026\u201d - @ChrisBHaynes  \u201cThey\u2019re bleeped. \u201d - Dan  Chris Haynes joins the show as we\u2026 pic. twitter. com/8SKHJzxtUm \u2014 Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz (@LeBatardShow) April 29, 2024 The Suns desperately needed a point guard to set the table for their three stars, but they also assembled a roster around three ball-dominant players. Durant will make $51. 2 million next season, Beal will receive $50. 2 million and Booker will make $49. 4 million. On top of that, they owe Jusuf Nurkic $18. 1 million and Grayson Allen $15. 6 million. An anonymous source within the Suns organization had this to say about Ishbia via Sam Amico of Hoops Wire: \"It's like Looney Tunes around here. It's felt unstable since [Ishbia] arrived. He's a good guy and everything, I think, but he's just very involved. Too involved. I know he played [college basketball], but I'd venture to say he has no idea what he's doing when it comes to basketball. Yet he's making a lot of the big decisions. \" There are rumors about how the Suns are considering firing first-year head coach, Frank Vogel, who was given a broken roster and was expected to win. The Suns are a mess and their first step is to find an identity within their front office. (Reaves returned Jan. 3 to replace Russell, while Russell and Hachimura later replaced Reddish and Prince with the first unit. ) Yet rather than the team's resiliency being applauded as the prevailing sentiment surrounding the late-season success, multiple team sources told ESPN that the Lakers should have -- or even would have -- finished better than No. 7 in the West and avoided the play-in tournament had Ham settled on that starting lineup much sooner. \"The job of a coach is to make the best out of what you have,\" one team source told ESPN. \"And he wasn't doing that. \" MONDAY'S PLAYOFF EXIT, at the hands of the Nuggets once again, is ultimately how this season will be remembered for the Lakers. Teams that lose in lopsided fashion don't get together decades later to reminisce, after all. The Suns' big three of Kevin Durant (35), Devin Booker (1) and Bradley Beal are left pondering what happened to them. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Biggest offseason need Roster symmetry and depth. This is easier said than done, however, given that the Suns are deep into the luxury tax, and with the CBA introducing new roster construction challenges, it will be difficult for the team to build upon the current foundation. Oh, and a point guard wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing either. Organizational vibe The 64-win Phoenix Suns of 2021-22 lost a heartbreaking seven-game Western Conference semifinals, traded the farm for Durant and lost a six-game, second-round set in 2023. So, they dealt the mortgage for Beal and were swept from this season's first round. [But] common sense tends to go out the window when you talk about my job in particular. \"It's amazing how people just skip that core part of having a consistency with your lineup is all predicated on health and performance. If you're coaching a team and one of your starters is like 10 games in a row, just s---ting the bed, what are you going to do?\" James' 71 games played were his most as a Laker and Davis' 76 appearances were the most in his 12-year career, but the Lakers' role players filled the injury list. Vanderbilt (53 games), Reddish (34 games) and free agent signees Gabe Vincent (71 games) and Christian Wood (32 games) all missed significant time. The Lakers ranked sixth in the NBA in missed games due to injury. Highlights The Suns were swept by the Timberwolves for the first time with Devin Booker, and changes are needed throughout the organization. Matt Ishbia's heavy involvement, hasty decisions, and ownership changes are hurting team chemistry and success. History of promising seasons leading to the downhill trajectory, lack of draft picks, and Beal's no-trade clause complicate potential rebuild. The Phoenix Suns were swept by the Minnesota Timberwolves following last night's game. It's the first time they have been swept with Devin Booker on the team, and they are hoping it is the last, but some major changes will need to come. One of those changes that must be looked at is how they are run as a team. Their plan of retooling in a short-term window has been nothing short of a failure..\n\nQuestion: What hindered the construction of chemistry on this NBA team?\nAnswers:\nA. Inconsistent stars\nB.

Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images After being selected by the Buffalo Bills with a second-round pick in the NFL draft on Friday, wide receiver Keon Coleman received a message from star quarterback Josh Allen that will surely boost his confidence. \"He texted me the day of and was like, 'You're the guy I want. I watched a lot of receivers and I want to play with you,'\" Coleman told reporters around the 3:00 mark of his introductory press conference. \"And I've been saying the same thing. I want to play with the guy that wears number 17. I think he's a great quarterback, one of the best in the league right now and I would love to be catching passes from him. I'm ready for that. Read their post-draft insights below. Check out ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper's grades for all 32 draft classes (ESPN+) and analysts Jordan Reid and Matt Miller's post-draft superlatives (ESPN+) for more insight into all seven rounds of the draft.

The Bills traded back twice in the first round, eventually selecting Keon Coleman with the first pick of the second round, and he immediately projects as the team's starting X receiver. He just talks about the guys he\u2019s watching, how he envisions them in our offense. Certainly, Xavier is one of those guys. \u201d Entering the draft, Veach and coach Andy Reid believed the Chiefs offense had to improve for the team to have a legitimate chance to win a third consecutive Super Bowl. The overall theme of the Chiefs\u2019 draft class is that Veach and Reid did their best to support their quarterback further. Four of the Chiefs\u2019 first five draft picks were offensive players. \u201cPatrick\u2019s a football junkie,\u201d assistant general manager Mike Borgonzi said Friday night. \u201cHe goes on his iPad and he watches the whole draft \u2014 and defensive players, too. That\u2019s just Patrick. Anytime we can add weapons for him or protection for him, I think he\u2019s going to be all for that. Nabers will have some trouble against press coverage early in his career and he\u2019ll have to expand his route tree. He needs to be in a system with coaches who can design ways to get the ball in his hands and Kafka and head coach Brian Daboll have shown they can do that. Kafka will draw up creative screens for Nabers and utilize motion to keep defenders from being able to press Nabers too often. Nabers will have a baptism-by-fire experience in New York with tight end Darren Waller mulling retirement and receiver Darius Slayton potentially holding out for a new contract. The target volume and snaps Nabers will see in his first season may not be of the highest quality with Jones throwing him the ball but the reps will be good for his long-term development. Playstyle: Played in a play-action-heavy offense. They lost Cedrick Wilson Jr. to the New Orleans Saints in the offseason, and regularly starting special teams aces Braxton Berrios and River Cracraft should be a last resort. Courtland Sutton, meanwhile, is an abundantly talented 6'4\" wideout who's been slightly miscast as an x-receiver for the Denver Broncos. He'd be better suited as a high-volume possession target in an offense that has other receivers capable of drawing safeties' attention down the field, thus being able to consistently win one-on-one matchups with his size and ball skills. Square peg, meet square hole. Courtland Sutton 2023 Stats Category Sutton Receptions 59 Yards 772 TDs 10 Rating w/ Targeted 120. 2 ADOT 11. 8 Sutton has played with a whopping 10 quarterbacks in seven seasons. The Eagles have aggressively addressed many issues that plagued them last season when they struggled down the stretch. Roseman gave the secondary a major shot in the arm with the draft. GO DEEPER Cooper DeJean joins Quinyon Mitchell as new Eagles DBs hoping to shore up secondary Playstyle: Big X receiver with vertical speed and jump-ball ability. Scheme: Shotgun, spread attack that utilizes RPOs and straight dropbacks more than play action. The Jaguars needed to draft a receiver after losing Calvin Ridley in free agency and Thomas may fit their offense better than Ridley did. As a rookie, Thomas might not be as productive as Ridley, who caught 76 passes for 1,016 yards last season, but he gives the Jaguars a true big-body X receiver who can stretch the field. Ridley was miscast in that role last season. \u201d The Chiefs\u2019 first selection was Texas wide receiver Xavier Worthy, who ran the 40-yard dash in a record-setting 4. 21 seconds at the NFL combine in March. Veach made a trade to ensure the Chiefs acquired Worthy, the receiver Mahomes was eager to have as a teammate. The Chiefs called the Buffalo Bills \u2014 the AFC contender they\u2019ve eliminated in the postseason in three of the past four years \u2014 to accomplish a swap of picks. The Chiefs sent the Nos. 32, 95 and 221 picks to Buffalo for picks 28, 133 and 248. GO DEEPER Chiefs 2024 NFL Draft takeaways: Improving on offense the clear priority Mahomes reacted to the Chiefs\u2019 selection of Worthy by posting a smiley face with sunglasses emoji on his X account. \u201cYou have some coaches you work with where they find the good in everybody,\u201d Veach said. But Barkley left in free agency and Jones is coming off yet another season-ending injury. The Giants don\u2019t have a choice but to move toward a more pass-centric attack. To that end, adding a receiver was necessary. GO DEEPER Daniel Jones getting one more chance, as Giants draft Malik Nabers after failing to trade up for QB Sure, they would have liked to move up and drafted Drake Maye, who would have helped the passing game more than a receiver, but the Patriots weren\u2019t going to trade down unless they got a historic offer. Getting Nabers isn\u2019t a bad consolation prize at all. Because of his ability to separate and create after the catch, the natural comparison is Tyreek Hill, whom Kafka coached in Kansas City. I\u2019m not saying Nabers will be as good as Hill, but there are some similarities in style..\n\nQuestion: Who did this NFL team select as their starting X receiver?\nAnswers:\nA.

The Reds' aspirations to end the season in success unravelled against the Irons as they could only draw. The results sees them five points behind Arsenal with three matches remaining of the season, and Man City able to overtake the Gunners via a game in hand. Several theories have been raised over the cause of Mohamed Salah\u2019s furious bust-up on the side of the pitch with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp , but new reports claim that it was due to a handshake snub. The Egyptian star was about to be brought on as a substitute in the 2-2 draw with West Ham when his outgoing head coach is said to have felt aggrieved by their interaction on the sideline. Salah flew in the face of Liverpool dressing room job given to him by Klopp Salah and Klopp could be seen arguing moments before the winger was brought onto the pitch, having been dropped from the starting lineup for the trip to West Ham. They were involved in an animated spat next to the fourth official, with Klopp appearing to go over to Salah to embrace him but was shunned. For me, that's done. \" Asked if Salah felt the issue was closed, Klopp said in his press conference: \"That's my impression, yes. \" Wide-angled footage showed Salah approaching the touchline with Nunez and Gomez to be subbed on, with Klopp reaching out to shake Salah's hand. The Egyptian was not immediately forthcoming, but shook Klopp's hand before an exchange of words. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Eleanor Roper and Charlotte Marsh dissect the dispute between Klopp and Salah at West Ham Klopp then hugged both Nunez and Gomez, before West Ham missed an opportunity, and Klopp clashed with Salah again, picked up clearly by the TV cameras. Jamie Carragher posted on X: \"The only reason a manager would be unhappy in this situation, is the player took too long to be ready to come on. The furious moment has left many questioning the relationship between Klopp and Salah with only three games remaining in their season. The Sun claim that the dispute started over Salah deciding against shaking Klopp\u2019s hand before heading onto the pitch. It is not the first time that such an incident has happened involving Klopp, but never this high-profile as the German coach is very keen on interacting with the substitutes before they come on.

I understand if Mohamed Salah has got the hump \u2013 Alan Shearer Alan Shearer believes Mohamed Salah is right to feel aggrieved about being left out of the Liverpool starting line-up on Saturday. Salah, for so long the Reds\u2019 chief attacking inspiration, was involved in a touchline row with manager Jurgen Klopp after being named on the bench for the Merseysiders\u2019 damaging 2-2 draw at West Ham. The result dealt another blow to Liverpool\u2019s already slim hopes of winning the Premier League title in Klopp\u2019s final season.

He did shoot 38. 6 percent in catch-and-shoot situations in that span, so it\u2019s possible he can be better in that area for his new team. He\u2019s also an elite free throw shooter, making 94. 3 percent this past season. McCollum can play either guard spot for his new team, though he was in an ideal situation at OU playing next to a bigger point guard in the 6-4 Milos Uzan. \u2014 C. J. 5 assists this season while shooting 46. 6 percent from the field, 39. 1 percent from 3 and 82. 8 percent from the line. He orchestrated the show for a team that made the NCAA Tournament and won the Summit League this year. Mayo is a real pull-up threat across the court. His 35-percent mark on 144 3-point attempts doesn\u2019t seem wild, but he got there on insanely difficult attempts that, by and large, he had to create himself. Only 10 players in college basketball took more pull-up 3-point attempts per game than Mayo, and he finished eighth among the 25 highest-volume pull-up 3-point shooters in percentage. Because he\u2019s constantly probing and a threat to get his shot off from any spot, defenders have to stay attached to him, which makes him an effective driver. He made a career-best 54 3s at a 42. 9 percent clip as a senior. Off the dribble, Roach has some burst and plays with aggression. He\u2019s small but doesn\u2019t have any trouble getting his shot off. He can score from all three levels and has good lift both at the basket and in the mid-range. He put up career-best numbers this season, averaging 14 points, 3. 3 assists and 1. 1 steals per game. He sometimes is overly aggressive in traffic. When he gets it in his head he\u2019s going to shoot, he\u2019s going to shoot and can have tunnel vision. If he sees a defender lift, he usually makes the right read. But if he dribbles into traffic, he can be turnover prone and take some tough shots. Shulga is originally from Ukraine and the stroke is reminiscent of fellow Ukrainian Svi Mykhailiuk, the former Kansas sharpshooter. It\u2019s compact and quick. His shot is proven over time too, as he\u2019s made 39. 5 percent of his 3s for his career. If you\u2019re looking for the Cam Spencer in this year\u2019s portal, this might be the guy. Spencer was sought after by UConn because of his shot but it turned out he was so much more. That could be Shulga, who played through back spasms late and still led the Rams in scoring and put up great efficiency numbers. \u2014 C. J. Moore How he fits Heise committed quickly to Iowa State out of the portal, and it's a good get for T. J. Otzelberger. Steven Vo talks about causing chaos on the basis, putting pressure on the other team, but somebody has to have the stop switch here. Somebody has to flash the red light now and then and we\u2019re going to have to see how they react to this. Joe Noga (11:50): And we had seen it earlier in the game. Chadwick the Atlantic catcher was not having a good game. He was pass balls, balls in the dirt, the balls that he wasn\u2019t blocking correctly to try and keep things in front of him. There were opportunities there to sort of push the issue and be aggressive. I mean Jose Ramirez had what taken a base just on making a good read on a ball in the dirt. So just those little things. Yeah, that\u2019s all great. \u2014 Sam Vecenie Ht: 6-7 Wt: 205 Storr was the best player on a Wisconsin team that ended up with a No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. He averaged 16. 8 points and 3. 9 rebounds on his way to second-team All-Big Ten, although his overall game does leave something to be desired beyond the scoring. The good news is that it\u2019s really hard to stop him from scoring. He\u2019s a big-time athlete out in transition and as a driver or cutter to the rim. That makes him a mismatch nightmare within college basketball. Once he gets a bit of downhill steam, he\u2019s going to get to the basket. Storr takes a ton of contested shots and doesn\u2019t really see the floor all that well in finding teammates for dump-off passes or kickouts. Storr made just 53. He has been the catalyst behind Rutgers finishing fourth and sixth in the country, respectively, in KenPom\u2019s adjusted defensive efficiency metric in each of the last two seasons. This season, he swatted 2. 9 shots per game in just 27 minutes per night, and while he earned Big Ten All-Defense honors for the season straight season, he should have been among the national semifinalists for the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year award. It is exceptionally hard to finish over his 7-foot-6 wingspan. Whichever team sways him will get an immediate upgrade on that end of the court. Omoruyi has been more hit-or-miss on offense, likely due to the way Rutgers used him. I\u2019ve always liked him most as a rim-runner in ball screens who occasionally rolled into quick duck-ins. 3 percent this past season. McCollum can play either guard spot for his new team, though he was in an ideal situation at OU playing next to a bigger point guard in the 6-4 Milos Uzan. \u2014 C. J. Moore Ht: 6-2 Wt: 160 McCollum was one of the best scoring guards in the Big 12. He averaged 13. 3 points and 3. 3 assists at OU, proving he can be productive at the high-major level. He\u2019s small, but he can fly and shake defenders with his speed and handle, whether in isolation or when playing out of the pick-and-roll, as he often did at OU. He\u2019s one of the rare players who shoots it better off the dribble than the catch. Last season, he made only 25. 6 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers, per Synergy, while shooting 39. The most promising ones were on defense, where Garrison is an athletic shot blocker whose length really plays up. He can block shots with both hands and improved his positioning in drop pick-and-roll coverage throughout the season. While he played a role in Oklahoma State having one of the Big 12\u2019s worst defenses, he, like the team\u2019s other bigs, was often hung out to dry by guards failing to stay in front of anyone. With more experience and in a more structured scheme, I expect Garrison to become a serious impact defender. On offense, Garrison\u2019s range doesn\u2019t extend far beyond finishing around the rim. However, I liked him most in ball-screens, where he showcased his mobility and created a great target for his guards with well-timed rolls. Getting one of the best available upperclassmen in the portal should help in a substantial way. Now, Kelsey just needs to keep finding more. \u2014 Sam Vecenie Stats Grade High Major Plus Year Graduate Years Remaining 1 Position Wing Wing Committed James Madison Louisville Cardinals Max Shulga Former Team VCU Former Team Ht: 6-5Wt: 200 Shulga is one of the best shooters in the portal, and he\u2019s not just a shooter.

Storr takes a ton of contested shots and doesn\u2019t really see the floor all that well in finding teammates for dump-off passes or kickouts. Storr made just 53. He can overpower perimeter players, and if you put a bigger guy on him, he can face up and drive to the basket. He\u2019s clearly put in the work to make himself a shooter. He shot just 22. 8 percent from 3 in two seasons at Louisville and has been a 36. 8 percent 3-point shooter the last two years at Seton Hall. He does most of his scoring in the paint, but he\u2019s capable of stepping out and knocking down a jumper. The threat of his shot has made him an even more dangerous slasher. Davis also rebounds well for his size (5. 9 per game) and is a willing passer (1. 6 assists per game) when he draws two to the ball. What you\u2019re getting in Davis is a grown man who knows how to play the game on both ends. He won the Missouri Valley Rookie of the Year award in 2022-23 in his first season at Belmont, then improved as a sophomore to earn second-team All-MVC honors. All told, he averaged 16. 2 points and 5. 9 rebounds per game while shooting 49. 3 percent from the field, 46. 5 percent from 3 and 85. 5 percent from the free-throw line last season. Tyson may be the best shooter in the portal, having drilled 44. 6 percent of his nearly 300 3-point attempts over his two college seasons. His preparation is superb, he fires with perfect alignment to the rim and generates a beautiful high arc with tremendous rotation on the ball. Shulga is originally from Ukraine and the stroke is reminiscent of fellow Ukrainian Svi Mykhailiuk, the former Kansas sharpshooter. It\u2019s compact and quick. His shot is proven over time too, as he\u2019s made 39. 5 percent of his 3s for his career. If you\u2019re looking for the Cam Spencer in this year\u2019s portal, this might be the guy.

Moore How he fits Heise committed quickly to Iowa State out of the portal, and it's a good get for T. J. Otzelberger. He can attack opposing bigs off the bounce in a serious way off of spot-up situations, getting to the rim quickly and finishing with flexibility. He has actual crossover moves and can pump fake to force a defender off their feet. He shot 47 percent from the field, which seems not great for a big, but it\u2019s because well over half of his attempts at the rim are self-created looks on drives or post-ups. But part of why the drives work is that Wolf can also step away and shoot the 3. He made 35 percent from distance this year, showing that you have to respect him out there. He has some real range out there, too. The key for Wolf is the growth trajectory he\u2019s on. Last year, he was a real project at Yale, getting only seven minutes per game. But I think Naylor really believes that he is convinced that he is the guy to do this, to carry the guardians to get the big hit. And he\u2019s done it time after time over the last two years and when he\u2019s up there, you can see why he\u2019s so confident Joe Noga (14:56): And go back to the game in Chicago where he had the eight rbis after the eighth inning or whatever and the phrase that he kept repeating when he got back to the dugout in his crazed helmet throwing whatever he said he wants all the smoke. Steven Vo talks about causing chaos on the basis, putting pressure on the other team, but somebody has to have the stop switch here. Somebody has to flash the red light now and then and we\u2019re going to have to see how they react to this. Joe Noga (11:50): And we had seen it earlier in the game.

There were opportunities there to sort of push the issue and be aggressive. I mean Jose Ramirez had what taken a base just on making a good read on a ball in the dirt. So just those little things. Yeah, that\u2019s all great. When Jose first came up and we got picked off at first base as a rookie and he asked him, what do you think you\u2019re invisible out there? (12:39): Do you think they don\u2019t see you when you\u2019re trying to steal? So obviously the same sort of situation with Kwan. Yeah, aggression is great, but when it costs you in big situations like that, you\u2019ve really got to reevaluate it. And we\u2019d even mention Josh Nailer is like the poster boy for this. It\u2019s he somehow thinks that he can just be out there stealing bases and that he\u2019s Usain Bolt in terms of his speed on the bases. He\u2019s been thrown out trying to take bases like that more times than we can count this season. 3 percent this past season. McCollum can play either guard spot for his new team, though he was in an ideal situation at OU playing next to a bigger point guard in the 6-4 Milos Uzan. \u2014 C. J.

Micky van de Ven thought he had drawn Tottenham level when he slammed home after Pedro Porro's shot deflected into his path, but VAR intervened to rule the centre-back was marginally offside. Arteta's men celebrated the decision as though they had scored themselves and they were doing exactly that in the 27th minute. Havertz floated a superb long pass to Saka on the right flank and the winger drove at Ben Davies before cutting inside to beat Guglielmo Vicario with a clinical low strike from 12 yards. Arsenal were ruthless in front of goal and Havertz grabbed their third with a well-worked corner routine in the 38th minute. It had got to a point where Spurs were relying on a mistake not to concede. So flimsy is their marking and tracking from corners, and so easily do they allow their keeper to be taken out of the equation, that if you get the delivery right and the header right you\u2019ll score. Arsenal didn\u2019t even need to get both parts right both times to cheerfully collect a couple of easy and hugely important goals here. On which note, perhaps our favourite single moment of the entire very silly game was Vicario going up for a last-minute corner and immediately standing on David Raya. And now look at them. And look at him. 11) Even allowing for the mania that overtook the game in the second half, there was still no clearer example of the gulf that now exists between these teams than the swift, clinical brilliance of the second goal. We wrote before the game about how Davies\u2019 composure and reliability might be just the thing for Spurs in a game of this heat and intensity over the more mercurial and volatile charms of the injured Destiny Udogie. Across the 90 minutes as a whole, that probably proved the case. But there was always one major problem with it. What if he got isolated against Saka with Van de Ven out of range to offer jet-heeled assistance? It would likely be very ugly indeed. Spurs lost the ball in the Arsenal penalty area, and via Rice and Havertz found themselves almost immediately in trouble. Davies must have known precisely what Saka was going to try and do, which only made his almost total inability to have any impact on it playing out as predictably as one could possibly imagine all the more striking. 12) But it wasn\u2019t just the goal that highlighted this gulf. A few minutes earlier, Leandro Trossard had lost possession inside his own penalty area. For approximately half a second, it looked like Spurs might be in. Yet in that blink of an eye, Arsenal had regrouped and had everyone back exactly where they wanted them, round pegs in round holes across the defence and midfield. Mikel Arteta acted on behalf of Arsenal as a whole, from the players to the supporters, when he produced his final touchline act in a breathless north London derby. The match was deep into stoppage time and the pressure was mounting on his players when the Arsenal manager stepped forward, in his dugout, and forcefully slapped the backside of Nicolas Jover. The message to Arsenal\u2019s set-piece coach, a key figure in their title charge, was clear. \u201cGo on, Nico. Get the job done. \u201d And so Jover hurried forward, squatting up and down with frenzied energy, as he successfully orchestrated Arsenal\u2019s defensive strategy in those last few minutes. Corner after corner was repelled, cross after cross was cleared \u2013 and Arsenal kept hold of the three points.

Romero should have equalised when Arsenal keeper David Raya misjudged James Maddison's free-kick, allowing the defender to rise for a close-range header that he somehow guided against the post rather than into the empty net. Micky van de Ven thought he had drawn Tottenham level when he slammed home after Pedro Porro's shot deflected into his path, but VAR intervened to rule the centre-back was marginally offside. Arteta's men celebrated the decision as though they had scored themselves and they were doing exactly that in the 27th minute. Havertz floated a superb long pass to Saka on the right flank and the winger drove at Ben Davies before cutting inside to beat Guglielmo Vicario with a clinical low strike from 12 yards. Arsenal were ruthless in front of goal and Havertz grabbed their third with a well-worked corner routine in the 38th minute..\n\nQuestion: What highlighted the gulf between Spurs and this Football club besides the goal?\nAnswers:\nA.

Fridolina Rolfo fired home from the penalty spot with 15 minutes to play to complete the defending champions\u2019 fightback and seal a 2-1 aggregate victory, after Emma Hayes\u2019 side had been made to endure the final half-hour with 10 players following the sending-off of Kadeisha Buchanan. Barca had already levelled the tie via a deflected finish from Ballon d\u2019Or winner Aitana Bonmati by the time the Chelsea defender saw red. Reaching for a loose ball inside the centre circle, she landed a foot on the ankle of Patri Guijarro and referee Iuliana Demetrescu did not hesitate in showing a second yellow card.

Buchanan was dismissed after two yellow cards in four minutes in the second half at Stamford Bridge, as Chelsea let a 1-0 first-leg advantage slip in a 2-0 second-leg loss. Aitana Bonmati\u2019s deflected goal and Fridolina Rolfo\u2019s penalty dumped Chelsea out of the competition \u2013 leaving Hayes\u2019 Champions League dream unfulfilled after 12 years with the Blues. A furious Hayes questioned UEFA\u2019s appointment of Romanian referee Iuliana Demetrescu, even claiming Barcelona\u2019s players admitted they had been given help by the officials in their victory. \u201cWhen you get such a shocking official\u2019s decision there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d said a devastated Hayes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough against 11 but when it\u2019s against 10 it\u2019s almost impossible. We had a great attitude last time but we didn't create much, we couldn't create the spaces. This game we were more patient, more calm, and really believed in it. On Barcelona's mentality: \"We have a winning mentality in the team. We all know it's possible. We have the people who can step up in the teams when we need them.

(Photo By Javier Borrego/Europa Press via Getty Images) Europa Press via Getty Images Money and trophies: what every soccer superstar desires. And lurking around every corner are rich and powerful European super clubs with a perpetual appetite for success and fat bank accounts to satisfy it. Less than two years ago, a little-known Georgian by the name of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was signed by Napoli. At the time, it was considered a risky move by the Partenopei who were transitioning into a new cycle of redevelopment. The world moves quickly for Bradley Barcola. As a youngster, his fleetness of foot earned him a few nicknames, the best of which was \u201cla sauterelle\u201d \u2014 the grasshopper. In a sense, that is what he is now for Paris Saint-Germain. He skips from point to point on the left wing, his bursts of speed catching defenders off guard and his slight frame masking the springs that make him play.

It is less than 18 months since Barcola was featuring for Lyon\u2019s reserves with his first-team ambitions apparently stalled. He was close to a loan move, to a club in Switzerland, to regain some momentum after making his senior debut in 2021. \u201cBradley was a gamble from sports management and staff,\u201d said Luis Enrique last month. \u201cHe is a young French player who has very high-level technical and physical potential.

After Newcastle at the Parc, he was very criticised, unfairly, and that did not reflect reality. \u201cSince then, he has succeeded in matches and that\u2019s not why we have to say only positive things today. He works very well day after day. \u201d Luis Enrique has built a team of efficient dribblers and while Dembele has excelled on the right, Barcola is competing at a similar level on the other side.

Salah has been the standout player of Klopp\u2019s reign, the genius in attack, the driving force behind so many wins. But the mind goes back to Sir Alex Ferguson announcing that the 2001-02 season would be his final year at United. Uncertainty set in, motivation dipped and United lost the title to Arsenal. Ferguson had given his players an excuse to let their standards dip. Thankfully for United, the Scot ended up staying and oversaw a new era of domination. Klopp, though, is not going to change course. He looks emotionally drained. He sounds as if he cannot wait for the season to end. It has to have an impact on the team. The mentality monsters have disappeared. There have, of course, been shows of petulance from Salah in the past. He had three forced fumbles. Walker has the option to return for the 2025 season, but if he follows up his breakout 2023 campaign with improvement this year \u2014 combined with his natural size and athleticism \u2014 the league might be the natural next step for the edge rusher.

He even dreamed up his own cast list when he learned Morris was trying to get his story turned into a film. She said: 'He began with Brad Pitt but quickly moved on to Ryan Gosling to play himself. For Gita it was only ever going to be Natalie Portman. 'Even on the eve of his 90th birthday Lali still saw himself as that dapper young man, the man he'd been before Auschwitz. 'He never lost that sense of himself. ' Jonah Hauer-King, who portrays Sokolov when he was an inmate, told the Mail's Weekend magazine: 'What drew me to the story is that you have two people allowing love to exist in a place like that.

Experienced right-back Dani Carvajal is suspended for the first leg at the Allianz, with Lucas Vazquez expected to start. What are the odds? Match result Bayern Munich - 13/10 Draw - 5/2 Real Madrid - 15/8 *Odds courtesy of Ladbrokes and are correct at the time of publication. In the most recent period of dominance, Cristiano Ronaldo broke countless Champions League records for both goals and appearances. The Portuguese superstar has made the most appearances (187), scored the most goals (141) and contributed the most assists (42) in Champions League history. His record in the latter stages of the competition is particularly impressive, having appeared in 21 Champions League semi-final matches. This is the record across both the UCL and European Cup eras of the competition. Ronaldo has scored 13 goals in semi-finals, far more than the tally of second-highest scorer and his former teammate Karim Benzema (eight). ..\n\nQuestion: Who is expected to be fully fit for Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg against this Football club?\nAnswers:\nA.

She injured her left foot during the WNBA Finals last season, and has been sidelined in training camp. \u201cWe'll be reevaluating her daily, but also probably in a couple of weeks,\u201d coach Becky Hammon said. \u201cShe's a little dinged up right now, so we'll take that one step at a time. \u201d.

Wrapping up Hannah Stuelke's parents are Mario Davis (father) and JoAnna Mantz (mother). Her parents played basketball while in college and later professionally. However, Hannah's father, Mario, introduced her to basketball. Since both her parents played basketball, they have supported their daughter's development as a college basketball player. Tuko. co. ke shared an article about Caitlin Clark's parents and ethnicity. Caitlin Clark is a professional basketball player from the United States who plays for the WNBA's Indiana Fever. Her parents are Brent Clark and Anne Nizzi-Clark. Her life has changed significantly due to her skill and popularity. She was a star in college basketball for years, but after Clark\u2019s Iowa Hawkeyes had a dramatic run to the NCAA Title game during her junior season, things changed. \u201cProbably after my junior year of basketball in college. But it's kind of grown on a level that's a lot different than what it was then,\u201d Clark said when asked about the moment her life became different and abnormal. \u201cI probably still don't really go about my life in the way that I probably should. I still try to do normal things and live as a normal person,\u201d she added before joking that she has a security team that follows her around now. That level of popularity comes with a ton of off-court experiences. \u201cI don\u2019t regret saying what I said, but I do wish I had articulated it better to reach people it should have reached,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t targeting the veterans. I was a veteran at LSU and I know how tough it is when you have rookies that don\u2019t respect the time you served. (I) wasn\u2019t trying to be that knucklehead rookie. It needed to be said and I said it. I apologized for how I said it. \u201d Looking ahead, Morris remains hopeful about the expansion of the WNBA, which is set to add a new team in the San Francisco Bay Area next year. \u201cI hope and wish one day they can expand and have more opportunities for the younger generation and talent that dream to play there,\u201d she expressed. HENDERSON, Nev. \u2014 Point guard Chelsea Gray signed a contract extension through 2025 to remain with the two-time WNBA defending champion Las Vegas Aces, the club announced Tuesday. \u201cI love this franchise, this team and the city of Vegas,\u201d Gray said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s become my home. It\u2019s my family\u2019s home. I\u2019m about championships and chasing history. We\u2019re so close and we\u2019ve created a trust, a bond, and want the best for each other all the time. I get to play alongside some future hall of famers that love winning as much as I do. We\u2019re chasing a legacy here in Vegas. \u201d Gray has won three championships: the past two years with the Aces and in 2016 with the Los Angeles Sparks. She\u2019s in countless commercials and has become one of the planet\u2019s most recognizable athletes. That will change everything for the Fever and the WNBA. Indiana hasn\u2019t made the playoffs since 2016 and has ranked bottom-two in attendance in each of the last two seasons. That will certainly change this year. \u201cI think there's gonna be a lot of new fans coming into the WNBA. There's already a lot of fans here,\u201d Clark said. \u201cJust continuing to grow that and attract that and keep those fans will be super important. \u201d The star guard is aware of her status and what it means for her and the Fever. But she has carried herself well in recent weeks and will hope to translate that to the court when Indiana\u2019s season begins next month. Is there a finite amount of ad dollars? Sure. Is everyone competing against everyone in some ways? Yes. But there\u2019s enough audience for both here to be successful.

Johnson wants to grow her basketball IQ and read defenders rather than relying on her athleticism to get by on offense. At 5-foot-8, Johnson is similar in size to Plum, which makes Plum\u2019s movements on the court a useful blueprint. Georgia Amoore found herself following the Aces star for the same reason. Amoore is another two-time member of the Dawg Class who craves as much instruction from Plum as possible to figure out how small guards can succeed in the WNBA. Georgia Amoore is one of the nation\u2019s elite college guards. She went to Florida to learn from one of the WNBA\u2019s best.

That\u2019s part of the magic Plum was trying to create with the Dawg Class. She wants players to be excited when they get invited, to think of it as an honor. And once they\u2019re at camp, even though she can direct them to what they need, Plum wants to be that primary resource. She\u2019s heartened that members of the 2023 Dawg Class heeded her suggestion to watch more film and updated their strength and conditioning regimens on her recommendation. \u201cIf I can get one-on-one time, watch how she operates \u2026 that was gonna be the biggest benefit for me. \u201d Though their listed heights may have been a bit generous, Amoore, who is 5-6, and Dyaisha Fair, who is 5-5, were particularly in tune with Plum\u2019s footwork on drives, how she positions the ball, and the angles of her finishes. It was clear the pair were mimicking those exercises in five-on-five, knowing the uphill battle that awaits them in the pros. Advertisement For Fair, that challenge is coming soon. Four days before arriving in Bradenton, she was drafted by Las Vegas, along with Martin. The duo were grateful for any tips on how to stick in the WNBA, especially as second-round picks, but they received the added advantage of getting some insight into the Aces organization.

They weren't alone in the fight, joined by wide-ranging groups with a stake in outcomes, including business groups, franchisees, and even unaffected smaller businesses that would not be subject to the wage increase requirement.

Posted by Bradford Betz Share Columbia University in talks with NYC Mayor Eric Adams as campus braces for more unrest Columbia University said Thursday that President Minouche Shafik has been in talks with New York City Mayor Eric Adams as the campus braces for more anti-Israel demonstrations. The university is anticipating another night of protests and counterprotests, starting around 6 p. m. local time at Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway and continuing for several hours. A university spokesperson said there is enhanced security around campus, and a faculty or student ID is required to enter the premise. The NYPD is aware of these planned protests and is adding personnel to maintain safety. The university is asking others to avoid the area. Abbott, a Republican, had earlier slammed the protesters who clashed with Texas Department of Public Safety troopers in riot gear during chaotic scenes.

Posted by Bradford Betz Share Anti-Israel protesters at Northeastern University cheer as police leave encampment A video on X from the Party for Socialism and Liberation shows students at Northeastern University cheering as police leave what the group described as a \u201cGaza Solidarity Encampment. \u201d Per local reports, an anti-Israel encampment formed Thursday on the university\u2019s Centennial Common. Dozens of people \u2013 including students and faculty \u2013 formed a ring around the encampment, drawing a response from police officers who asked them to leave. Police later were withdrawn, prompting cheers from the crowd. Colleges across the U. S. are reporting that some of the anti-Israel protesters participating in and getting arrested at demonstrations are not part of the school community and instead are outsiders. Emory University in Atlanta released a statement Thursday that 28 people were arrested during a demonstration at the Emory quad, 20 of whom were members of the school community. In the statement, Cheryl Elliott, the vice president of public safety at Emory University, said a few dozen protesters arrived at campus just before 7:45 a. m. When the protesters arrived, she said, they ignored and pushed past Emory Police Department (EPD) officers stationed at the quad and set up tents in an area where equipment and materials were staged for a commencement ceremony. The decision prompted backlash from Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and ignited a tiff between the lawmaker and the police force online. \"Good SAT scores and self-entitlement do not supersede the law,\" NYPD Chief John Chell wrote in a tweet early Thursday morning. \"Columbia decided to hold its students accountable to the laws of the school,\" he added. \"I am sure you would agree that we have to teach them these valuable life skills. \" The comment came after Ocasio-Cortez complained Wednesday that Columbia made \"the horrific decision to mobilize NYPD on their own students. \" The students are protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has resulted in tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths. Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for additional comment, but a response was not immediately received..\n\nQuestion: What is this Educational institution doing in preparation for anti-Israel demonstrations?\nAnswers:\nA.

He will have an excellent chance to win his third MVP Award. Apr 27, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; Denver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone and center Nikola Jokic Jason Parkhurst-USA TODAY Sports Game 5 of the series will be on Monday evening in Denver. The winner of the series will advance to the second round and face off against either the Phoenix Suns or the Minnesota Timberwolves. Irving hit the next two 3s for Dallas, and the rally was on. He scored 16 in the second quarter and kept it going in the third, finishing those two quarters with 26 after a scoreless first. Dallas trailed by four entering the fourth quarter. Playoff Lu Dort remains blitzing the nets, Josh Giddey loves walking into New Orleans and the Thunder are making up for their rebounding deficiency with a feisty defense willing to compete for 24 seconds, then 14 more. This has all been part of their identity all year long on the floor. Blend that with their uncommon maturity and 0-0 mindset and they sit on the cusp of their first playoff series win since Kevin Durant was in town. With Oklahoma City up 2-0, they could've been complicit or they could've been hit in the mouth by their afternoon boogeyman, instead, they took care of business. As the Thunder sit up 3-0, there is optimism around them pulling off one of the toughest things to do in the NBA - A sweep. Now, they are pretty good at dragging teams into their preferred style of game with their physicality and defense, but their margin for error is just razor-thin. Josh Hart has been amazing. OG Anunoby is giving them strong two-way play. Mitchell Robinson and Isaiah Hartenstein are a really nice center rotation (although they now have health concerns with Robinson). Their wins in New York were impressive showings of resolve and late-game wherewithal, but if it\u2019s going to be that hard every night you have to think it takes a toll. Jalen Brunson getting going in Game 3, even in a loss, is helpful after a woeful first two games in New York, but they\u2019ll need a truly special run from him (like he had to close the regular season) to make a deep run. 5.

Joki\u0107, who had 33 points, 14 rebounds and 14 assists on Saturday, has been the best player in the series. What\u2019s been most encouraging is it certainly seems as though they\u2019ve been able to carry over their strong defensive performance from the last two months of the regular season into the postseason. That the Mavs are able to win games in which they don\u2019t shoot it well \u2014 and particularly a Game 3 that Luka Doncic didn\u2019t shoot it well \u2014 is a very good sign for their prospects going forward. The rest of the top of the West can force you into a defensive game and being able to get in the mud and win those kinds of games is vital. We knew Dallas could win with their offense when Doncic and Kyrie Irving have it rolling, but now they\u2019ve proven that late season defensive surge was for real and they can win a slugfest too. 4.

Dallas trailed by four entering the fourth quarter. Reggie Jackson played nine minutes for Denver despite spraining his ankle in the second half of Game 3. Malone initially didn't think Jackson would be available for Game 4, but the 13-year veteran stunned the coaches with his quick recovery. Caleb Williams, the Heisman Trophy-winning former USC quarterback and the No. 1 overall pick in this weekend's NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, watched the game from courtside.

The statistics don't tell all of the story but they do sing a remarkable song. As ESPN summarized, she won NCAA titles at Tennessee in 2007 and 2008. Then she was picked first in the 2008 WNBA draft.

Through a mixture of the English Woodland Grant and Countryside Stewardship schemes between April 2006 and December 2022 we worked with land managers to plant 167 hectares of new woodland. This was across 119 unique plantings, equivalent to around 210,000 trees in the River Wye SAC catchment. This has created habitat that secures soil in place and acts as a barrier for over-land runoff of nutrients and eroded soil. In addition, the right trees in the right place can provide shade to the river, helping to reduce its temperature and adapt to hotter weather due to climate change protecting sensitive species such as salmonids. Under this new requirement, the manure they produce will no longer be allowed to contribute to that surplus. During the development of these requirements, we will consider emerging approaches to managing and utilising organic manures to ensure the regulations recognise, and do not stifle, innovation and technologies that deliver environmental benefits. Help farmers retain more nutrients and soil in the field From summer 2024, we will introduce Sustainable Farming Incentive ( SFI ) funding to support the establishment of crops using no-till techniques, for spring and summer cover crops, and the precision application of crop nutrients and plant protection products. We will provide premium SFI payment rates for a range of high impact actions, including offering \u00a31,182 per hectare for 3-dimensional waterbody buffer strips between 6 and 24 metres wide. Miers was taken at pick 57 in the 2017 national draft, while Close, Jack Henry, Ollie Dempsey, Mark Blicavs, Tom Atkins, and Zach Guthrie were all taken after pick 11 in their rookie drafts.

Reducing the impact of invasive non-native species We are working in partnership with the Wye and Usk Foundation, through our Farming in Protected Landscapes ( FiPL ) programme, to control invasive plants in the River Wye SAC catchment between Glasbury and Ross-on-Wye.

Action to stop the decline of the River Wye In this plan we are making 9 commitments. Research led by Lancaster University concluded the majority of the surplus phosphorus added to the soils of the River Wye catchment each year, estimated at 3,000 tons, are from livestock manures, especially poultry. These will create habitat corridors throughout the catchment and protect watercourses; a 24 m wide wooded buffer can intercept more than three quarters of phosphorus that would otherwise pass through it to a water body.

Support the management of poultry manure by funding poultry manure combustors We will support poultry farmers to export poultry litter to where it is needed by providing up to \u00a335 million in grant funding for on-farm poultry manure combustors ( PMCs ). These were delivered by advisers from CSF , the Wye and Usk Foundation, Herefordshire Wildlife Trust and Herefordshire Rural Hub. Through a mixture of the English Woodland Grant and Countryside Stewardship schemes between April 2006 and December 2022 we worked with land managers to plant 167 hectares of new woodland. This was across 119 unique plantings, equivalent to around 210,000 trees in the River Wye SAC catchment. This has created habitat that secures soil in place and acts as a barrier for over-land runoff of nutrients and eroded soil. In addition, the right trees in the right place can provide shade to the river, helping to reduce its temperature and adapt to hotter weather due to climate change protecting sensitive species such as salmonids.

In a statement, Renata Nyul, VP for Communications, Northeastern, said a student demonstration was \"infiltrated\" by outside organizers who made gross antisemitic statements that are not tolerated on Northeastern's campus. \u201cEarlier this morning the Northeastern University Police Department (NUPD) \u2014 in cooperation with local law enforcement partners \u2014 began clearing an unauthorized encampment on the university\u2019s Boston campus,\" Nyul said. The drums have been beating for nearly a fortnight at Manhattan\u2019s Columbia University, the noise reverberating around the campus of one of America\u2019s most prestigious seats of learning. It is energising some students and academics but putting others on edge, for the drums are the accompaniment to ceaseless chants about the virtues of the Palestinian cause and the wickedness of \u2018colonial\u2019 Israel. Protesters insist they are demanding only peace in Gaza and an end to the humanitarian crisis there, and complain that anti-Zionism shouldn\u2019t be confused with anti-Semitism. However, many of the slogans and placards tell a very different story: \u2018Brick by brick, wall by wall, Israel will fall\u2019; \u2018There is only one solution, intifada revolution\u2019; \u2018From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u2019 and \u2018By any means necessary\u2019. They call, implicitly or explicitly, for the extinction of Israel. NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell and Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry were interviewed on \"The Story\" and said that the role of police is to remain neutral and protect people while respecting the First Amendment rights of demonstrators. However, they emphasized that protesters will not be permitted to take over the streets of New York City, like what happened in Seattle's \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone\" (CHAZ) in 2020. \"We will not have any Seattle-type encampments on the streets of New York City,\" Chell said. \"I can guarantee you that would end rather quickly. \" The officials also commented on the language directed at police officers from protesters, comparing public safety officials to the KKK. Chell said those comments were \"reprehensible\" and \"disgusting. \" Daughtry said that if his officers spoke how the professors and faculty spoke to them, they would face disciplinary action. m.

There may be commitments on more funds for adaptation to climate change, and Italy said the G7 would discuss \"innovative\" financing models amid calls for more accessible finance for vulnerable countries.

The Group of Seven meeting in the northern Italian city is the first big political session since the world pledged at the UN's COP28 climate summit in December to transition away from coal, oil and gas. UN climate chief Simon Stiell kicked off the talks by urging the highly industrialised countries to use their political clout, wealth and technologies to end fossil fuel use. \"I often hear in forums like this one that, 'we cannot possibly move too far forward, lest we predetermine the outcome of negotiations'\" at the UN level, Stiell told the ministers.

Currently, the G7 are collectively only targeting a doubling of renewable capacity, leaving a gap of 0. 7 TW (Terawatt) to tripling according to an analysis by Ember, an independent energy think tank. Ember is an energy think tank that aims to accelerate the clean energy transition with data and policy. According to Ember\u2019s 2030 Global Renewable Target Tracker, the collective sum of the G7 members\u2019 2030 renewable capacity targets is 2 TW. This is just over a doubling (2. 2X) of 2022 capacity (0. 9 TW). A tripling of renewable capacity is 2. 7 TW, leaving a 0. 7 TW gap between current targets and a tripling aligned goal. \u201d The 2023 COP28 Summit was the 28th United Nations Climate Change conference, held from November 30 to December 13 in Dubai.

Our slogan is \u201cThe only awards show with the Caribbean Sea as the stage. Karol G is taking a break from her successful tour to spend some quality time with her family. The Colombian singer is known for always being surrounded by her loved ones, especially her mom and dad, who have been there from the early stages of her career, and now with her incredible achievements.

Karol G was seen heading to the airport, after attending a tango show in Buenos Aires with her parents and her inner circle.

Advertisement After a few minutes, state troopers started advancing toward the encampment and surrounding it. Protesters who returned to the University of Texas at Austin on Monday were greeted by dozens of law enforcement officers, many in riot gear. At least 43 protesters were arrested as police and campus security used pepper spray and flash-bang charges on the crowd. The Republican governor, Greg Abbott, on social media reposted video of troopers arriving on the 50,000-student campus. \u201cNo encampments will be allowed.

After news of the arrests broke, videos popped up on social media of protesters being sprayed with pepper spray as police were pushing them off the road. \u201cBaseball size rocks were found strategically placed within the encampment.

Those arrested last week faced charges of criminal trespassing, but Travis County prosecutors declined the charges. Olive Gonzalez, 22, a senior advertising student who didn\u2019t join the protests last week but decided to show support today, said law enforcement\u2019s presence is excessive.

Sarah Eckhardt said via a phone interview that she was headed to UT\u2019s South Lawn to monitor the protests. Eckhardt said she has not been in contact with UT President Jay Hartzell. She noted that the decision to remove tents was consistent with demands UT made last week. Officials \u201cwere clear in communicating that on the first day, Wednesday, that tents were a type of visible obstruction that they were trying to avoid,\u201d she said. \u201dThe best course of action is to reach out to as many grass-top influencers to deescalate the situation as I can,\u201d Eckhardt added. Across the country, pro-Palestinian protests have taken place on college campuses recently. Demonstrators want a cease-fire in Gaza and for their universities to divest from companies that make weapons used in the war. It also challenges the move away from in-person classes and seeks quick court action requiring Columbia to provide security for the students. Meanwhile, a legal group representing pro-Palestinian students is urging the U. S. Department of Education's civil rights office to investigate Columbia's compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for how they have been treated. The plight of students who have been arrested has become a central part of protests, with the students and a growing number of faculty demanding amnesty for protesters. At issue is whether the suspensions and legal records will follow students through their adult lives. Gaza war protests ignite on US college campuses. \u201c91 individuals, 54 of whom are current Virginia Tech students, were arrested and all were charged with trespassing,\u201d the the statement said. The arrests began around 10:20pm, five minutes after police warned protesters they would be considered trespassers if they did not disperse.

Students and others have been sparing over the Israel-Hamas war and its mounting death toll. Many students are demanding their universities cut financial ties with Israel.

This acquisition, valued at approximately $7. 8 million, was revealed alongside the firm's first-quarter financial results, highlighting a steadfast dedication to expanding its cryptocurrency investments. MicroStrategy's Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation Hits 214,400 BTC, Highlighting Long-Term Digital Asset Commitment In a recent report by CoinGape, MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor revealed that the latest acquisition raised the firm's total Bitcoin holdings to 214,400 BTC. This announcement was made in conjunction with MicroStrategy's first-quarter financial report. According to the released statement, the entire BTC holding was acquired for an average of $35,180 per unit. Despite the digital asset impairment hit in the first quarter, Saylor remains enthusiastic about MicroStrategy's future through its Bitcoin strategy. A few hours after announcing his company's net losses, the tech mogul urged investors to adopt their own BTC strategy.

References to MicroStrategy below refer to MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. (a) In the first quarter of 2023, MicroStrategy purchased bitcoin using $179. 3 million of the net proceeds from its sale of class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program. (b) In the second quarter of 2023, MicroStrategy purchased bitcoin using $336. 9 million of the net proceeds from its sale of class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program, and Excess Cash. (c) In the third quarter of 2023, MicroStrategy purchased bitcoin using $147. 3 million of the net proceeds from its sale of class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program, and Excess Cash. (d) In the fourth quarter of 2023, MicroStrategy purchased bitcoin using $1. Canaccord cut its price target for MicroStrategy to $1,590 from $1,810. The company bought more bitcoin in the first quarter and now owns a total of 214,400 BTC worth about $13. 6 billion, the report said. MicroStrategy reported a first-quarter net operating loss of $53. 1 million after taking a digital asset impairment charge of $191. 6 million. MicroStrategy (MSTR) raised over $1. 5 billion in the first quarter and used the proceeds to acquire an additional 25,250 bitcoin {{BTC}} and now owns 214,400 BTC worth around $13. 6 billion, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Monday. MicroStrategy\u2019s corporate strategy is partly based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The firm\u2019s total holding is almost 1% of bitcoin\u2019s total circulating supply of 19. 7 million tokens. MicroStrategy (MSTR) reported a net operating loss of $53. 1 million, or $3. 09 per share, in the first quarter after taking a digital asset impairment charge of $191. 6 million, according to a Monday afternoon press release. While some had expected the company might adopt the new digital asset fair value accounting standard, and thus report a sizable profit thanks to bitcoin's {{BTC}} first quarter rally, the company elected not to do so. By the old standard, MicroStrategy at quarter's end valued its bitcoin holdings at a price of $23,680 each, or $5. 1 billion, rather than March's closing price of $71,028, or $15. 2 billion. The company also announced a small April addition of 122 tokens to its bitcoin stack, bringing total holdings to 214,400. That would be valued at $13. 5 billion at bitcoin's current price of about $63,000. 9 million in the first quarter of 2023, marking a significant difference from the Q1 2024 results, and highlighting the volatility of the cryptocurrency market that MicroStrategy jumped into. Still, the company appears hell-bent on maintaining its Bitcoin strategy. For the entire quarter, the maximalist firm acquired 25,250 more Bitcoin from the end of Q4 2023, seemingly in a bid to retain its position as the top-known corporate BTC holder in the world.

Bitcoin has been struggling to break past the $63,000 mark since the halving on April 20, and as of early Tuesday, was trading between $62,500 and $62,800. (Bloomberg) \u2014 Michael Saylor\u2019s decision back in 2020 to start buying Bitcoin has paid off in spades this year for the co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy Inc. MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor. (Bloomberg) Most Read from Bloomberg Saylor has garnered an estimated $400 million or so from pre-planned daily sales of about 5,000 shares of the enterprise software company from January through last week, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The share sales follow the exercising of options awarded in 2014 that were set to expire. The stock has doubled this year to around $1,290, surpassing the record-setting gains of the original cryptocurrency during the same period. At the end of 2014, MicroStrategy was trading at around $160. The outperformance of Tysons Corner, Virginia-based MicroStrategy\u2019s stock appears to be negating investor concern that Saylor, who is the controlling shareholder, may be selling at the peak. Co-founder of MicroStrategy Inc. , Michael Saylor has reportedly earned around $400 million from pre-planned daily sales of the enterprise software company\u2019s shares. This windfall stems from a strategic move initiated back in 2020 when Saylor began accumulating Bitcoin, a decision that has proven immensely lucrative. The significant rise in MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price this year, doubling to approximately $1,280, has substantially contributed to Saylor\u2019s profits, outpacing even the gains seen in the original cryptocurrency during the same period. Future of Bitcoin and MicroStrategy Anticipation mounts as investors await MicroStrategy\u2019s first-quarter results, scheduled for release after regular stock trading on Monday.

David Gilbert vs Stephen Maguire prediction (10am Tuesday, BBC Two and Eurosport) Gilbert and Maguire were not meant to get this far. Both needed two qualifying rounds to get into the main event and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve each rumbled two higher seeds to get to Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s table. Gilbert has been the surprise package so far, having dumped defending champion Luca Brecel and seasoned veteran Robert Milkins out. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enjoyed three century breaks so far and is now one win away from emulating his run to the semi-finals in Sheffield in 2019. Maguire came into the Championship in good form and is a two-time semi-finalist. He also has a 5-2 career record over Gilbert, which is why William Hill price him as the 10/11 favourite to win. Maguire, who has banked a minimum of \u00a350,000, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not been a great 15 years \u2013 let\u2019s be honest. \u201cEach season is getting faster and faster and faster. It\u2019s disappearing quickly now. \u201cResults like this and being in the quarter-finals of the worlds again, I have to pat myself on the back and enjoy it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I am world-class but I am trying hard to let the other guy beat me. \u201cRather than me beat myself, which I have done through my career. Try to stand up to them. If they beat me, then shake their hand and say well done. \u201cDave\u2019s playing well and back to his best. He will probably go in as favourite on form. I will put up a fight. \u201d ALL THE LATEST FROM THE WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP 2024. Gilbert is clearly playing well but his only ranking-event win came in the Championship League in 2021 and at some point he may be bogged down by the pressure. Judd Trump vs Jak Jones predictions Judd Trump is expected to hold the aces in this quarter-final clash and, while the 2019 champion should progress, Jones may have been seriously underestimated in the handicap betting. Trump has barely been tested at this year\u2019s World Championship, having eased past Hossein Vafaei 10-5 before recording a 13-7 win over Tom Ford, but Jones looks a complete natural on the big stage and can offer greater resistance. The Welshman made the quarter-final on his Crucible debut last season and, following wins over Carter and Neil Robertson, was far from disgraced in a 13-10 defeat to Mark Allen. However, Maguire sealed victory in style, hitting the only century of the match with a 127 to set up a meeting with David Gilbert. Maguire told the World Snooker Tour website: \u201c(Murphy) looked like he was comfortable in that session, so I was starting to get geared up for a comeback and a close finish. Once I got my chance, I finished pretty well there. \u201cMe and Dave (Gilbert) get on and we\u2019ve grown up with each other for the best part of 30 years. He is a great player. He\u2019s not had a great season by his standards. I\u2019m probably the same, so we are coming into a good game at the right time. \u201cThe quarter-finals are the pressure matches. I\u2019ve won a couple and lost a couple. Backing Maguire makes sense. He has the better record at the Crucible and the better head-to-head record, and hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rode his luck nearly as much as Gilbert to reach this stage.

Here's a look at all the players with at least 25 victories. this makes it all worthwhile. \u201d Some of the vitriol toward Norman is not likely to subside. To many, he\u2019s viewed as the person who divided the game\u2014even if it is far more complicated than that. But Norman did deliver on his idea in his homeland, and he told Australian Golf Digest that he\u2019s looking to bring the concept to other places, such as South Africa. Next up is this week\u2019s event in Singapore. And a few more things. Rory McIlroy was credited with his 25th PGA Tour victory after winning the Zurich Classic with Shane Lowry. And he\u2019s entered some rare air among all-time PGA Tour winners. That tied him with Johnny Miller at 23rd all time along with Tommy Armour and Macdonald Smith. He\u2019s one behind Henry Picard. It pays to play well on the PGA Tour. Just ask this week\u2019s winners, Shane Lowry and Rory McIlroy. The Ryder Cup teammates won the 2024 Zurich Classic of New Orleans at TPC Louisiana in Avondale on Sunday after a one-hole playoff against Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer. The win is the 25th of McIlroy\u2019s career and third of Lowry\u2019s on the PGA Tour. McIlroy and Lowry will each bank $1,286,050, while Ramey and Trainer will earn $525,100 as a consolation prize. Ryan Brehm and Mark Hubbard finished a shot back in third and will take home $343,763 a piece.

Prize money payouts. \u201cI've enjoyed every minute of it, like having this man by my side \u2014 you saw the drive he hit up the 18th, the 72nd hole. When you've got him doing that, it's pretty easy to play golf from there for me. \u201cI made it look hard at times, but no, it was amazing. We went out there, we had loads of fun, and we won the Tournament. You couldn't ask for a better week. \u201d McIlroy has not looked to be enjoying his golf as much of late and had recorded just one top 10 in eight PGA Tour starts before getting over the winning line last night. Playing with Lowry appeared to lighten the load and it may prove a turning point for him as he seeks to end that long wait for a fifth Major win. pic. twitter. com/MngQzion20 \u2014 Oisin Langan (@oisinlangan) April 28, 2024 Shane Lowry and Rory McIlroy what an Irish bromance \u2014 Ross McGinley (@RossMcGinley94) April 28, 2024 The bromance between McIlroy and Lowry is alive and well. They have already committed to returning in 2025 to defend their title in New Orleans. It was a monumental day for the 34-year-old. To get that 25th win means he joins Johnny Miller, Tommy Armour and Macdonald Smith on the all-time wins list. McIlroy is one of 26 players with at least 25 wins on the PGA Tour as he continues cementing his legacy. Savannah Leigh Richardson is a golf staff writer for SB Nation\u2019s Playing Through.

Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry had to fight hard on Sunday, but the duo prevailed at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer posted the score to beat at 25-under, then had to wait for nearly three hours for the 54-hole leaders to finish. The Irish duo was the only pair who could get there as they posted a 4-under 68 to force one extra hole.

This victory marked McIlroy\u2019s 25th PGA Tour victory. Stuart Macdonald carded a 1-under 71 on Sunday to win the Diners Club Peru Open on the PGA Tour Americas. Macdonald entered the day as the leader and held off American Sam Anderson to win the event by two shots. This is the second time Macdonald has won in Peru. He won the 29th Lima Golf Club International Amateur Championship in 2017. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely thrilled,\u201d said Macdonald. \u201cI love Lima, I love the city, I love everything about it. And yeah, if I was going to win a tournament in the Latin swing, I would choose this one. This feels super special, it\u2019s an unbelievable tournament. \u201d After starring at Purdue University as an amateur, Macdonald turned professional in 2017. The win now gives him six victories as a pro. \"To win any PGA Tour event is very cool, but to do it with one of your closest friends \u2014 we've known each other for a long, long time, probably like over 20 years,\" McIlroy said. \"To think about where we met and where we've come from, to be on this stage and do this together \u2014 really, really cool journey that we've been a part of. \" McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, won his 25th PGA Tour title and first of the season. Lowry, of Ireland, claimed his third PGA Tour victory. Each walked away with about $1. 29 million and 400 FedEx Cup points apiece. \"People have come out in the thousands to support us. It's not lost on me how cool that is,\" McIlroy said. Sens: I dunno. Clearly, for some people, no amount of money is enough. I figure these guys are probably satisfied with this particular exchange. The more important question in the long run is, how happy are fans with the product the pro game is putting out? Maybe they should dole out some \u2018loyalty\u2019 money to folks at home to ensure that they keep tuning in. 4. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry won the Zurich Classic, beating Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer on the first playoff hole. McIlroy and Lowry, who decided to play the event on a whim, entered the week with 26 combined PGA Tour wins and five major titles, while Ramey and Trainer had won just once each.

Curt Myers, chairman and CEO of Fulton, said the transaction would double its presence in the Philadelphia region. The collapse of Republic Bank marks the sixth largest failed bank since 2010, but far smaller than the collapses of SVB and First Republic, which both had more than $200 billion in assets and Signature, who had over $100 billion, according to an analysis by S&P Global Ratings. S&P noted that similar to last year\u2019s bank failures, Republic First was undone by unrealized loan losses compounded by elevated interest rates. (Reuters) - Fulton Financial's shares jumped on Monday after it bought the deposits and assets of Republic First from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in what is the first U. S. bank failure of 2024. Regional banks have been struggling to retain deposits as customers seek the safety of larger 'too-big-to-fail' rivals, while higher interest rates have also diminished the value of their loan books due to increased unrealized losses. Republic Bank's troubles included low liquidity, not filing annual reports detailing year-end financials with the U. S. SEC and being targeted by multiple activist investors since 2021. The beleaguered lender, which had about $6 billion and $4 billion in total assets and deposits, respectively, was closed on Friday by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The FDIC was appointed its receiver. 6 billion in deposits. Fulton\u2019s loan-to-deposit ratio has decreased from 99 percent to 92 percent following the acquisition, effectively improving its risk profile and liquidity, according to a press release issued by the bank. As early as Saturday, April 27, some of Republic First\u2019s 32 bank branches across Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey had reopened as Fulton Financial locations. During the transition, customers with Republic First accounts retained uninterrupted access to their funds, including the use of debit cards issued by that institution and the writing of checks drawn on those accounts, according to the FDIC. The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Republic First faced liquidity concerns for several months, including aforementioned bond losses. The Journal also reported that state regulators had been prepared to seize Republic First as recently as last November. Key Takeaways Fulton Financial acquired the debt and deposits of Republic First Bank after the first bank failure of 2024. Republic was seized by state regulators Friday after a deal for $35 million in funding reportedly fell apart earlier this year. The seizure and sale comes a little over a year after a series of bank failures rocked the industry in 2023. Fulton Financial (FULT) shares surged Monday after the bank said it acquired the debt and deposits of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank following the first bank failure of 2024. Republic First Bank was seized by regulators Friday after a deal for $35 million in funding reportedly fell apart earlier this year. After a deal was reached with Fulton, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said the Fulton deal was the least costly path for the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Story continues As part of the transaction, Fulton is donating $5 million to provide grants to nonprofits that promote economic empowerment, particularly in underserved communities. Fulton Bank, which dates to 1882, is part of a $27 billion holding company, Fulton Financial Corp. It has more than 200 \"financial centers\" in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Pennsylvania, including Lower Makefield, Doylestown, Bensalem, Upper Southampton and Warminster. Customers with questions about Republic's acquisition may call the FDIC toll-free at 1-877-467-0178. The line will be staffed Monday from 8 a. m. to 8 p. m. ; and thereafter from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. Interested parties may also visit the FDIC\u2019s website. Jim Walsh is a senior reporter with the Courier-Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal. Email: Jwalsh@cpsj. com. The collapse of First Republic Bank followed in May. The crisis put a squeeze on smaller regional banks to compete for deposits as many consumers fled to the security of larger banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which acquired First Republic last year and was one of several large banks that stepped in to provide financial assistance. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter earlier this month that the worst of the banking crisis seemed to have passed, but warned persistently high interest rates could cause trouble for regional banks across the country. What Happens Next Fulton agreed to acquire all $6 billion of Republic's assets, along with the bank's $5. 3 billion in liabilities in the form of $4 billion in deposits and \"other borrowings and liabilities\" of $1. 3 billion..\n\nQuestion: What bank did this Bank acquire after its failure in 2024?\nAnswers:\nA.

So if she\u2019s wrong about Daniel, what does that mean about all these things she\u2019s believed so strongly were true? Even though in the movie it\u2019s just this little moment, it was really important to me that this isn\u2019t a movie about \u201cDaniel gets to be happy, and I\u2019m not happy,\u201d Daniel\u2019s still got his own shit going on. A kind of happy by-product of it is that it allows the audience to soften on Daniel a little bit at the end of the movie. He\u2019s sort of in the box of being the bad guy. But I think when you see Daniel at the end of the movie, and you know that he\u2019s probably dealing with some of his own stuff, it allows you to see him as a human being as well. The icing on the cake is being nominated with my onstage wife, Maryann Plunkett and our book writer Bekah Brunstetter. Thank you to Michael Greif and Schele Williams for taking me on this journey, to Ingrid Michelson for the most beautiful score, and to my fellow Notebook cast, you\u2019ve helped me fly!\u201d Betsy Aidem, Prayer for the French Republic Betsy Aidem, Prayer for the French Republic Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play \u201cGetting to do Josh Harmon\u2019s beautiful play was the prize. Working with David Cromer and the most wonderful cast was the prize. To be occupying the very thin space between extremely late bloomer and posthumous is a most unexpected thrill. \u201d Derek McLane , Purlie Victorious Best Scenic Design of a Play \u201cI was absolutely thrilled to learn of this nomination. \u201d David Adjmi, Stereophonic Best Play Thank you to the Broadway League and the American Theatre Wing for this extraordinary honor. I cannot stress enough how incredible it feels to be nominated alongside some of the best American playwrights working today. When I started work on Stereophonic eleven years ago, I didn\u2019t think it would end up on Broadway; I didn\u2019t know if it would even be produced. I made extraordinary demands on my cast, my director, my creative team, my composer, and pretty much everyone involved\u2014and these people not only met the very high bar I set, but they also surpassed it. Will, Daniel and I spent over a decade working on this play without knowing if it would ever see the light of day. So, to experience this trajectory is, quite frankly, completely shocking. But to have validated the love that I have and admiration I have for the people I\u2019m working with is such a good feeling. It\u2019s like it\u2019s all of their birthday parties on the same day and everyone has shown up to give them flowers. I\u2019m going to eat a BLT with avocado on it, I\u2019m going to drink hibiscus and rose flavored Something & Nothing, I\u2019m going to walk through the park. Sarah Pidgeon and I both graduated from Carnegie Melon, and they have their showcase in midtown, and we\u2019re going to go and watch!\" Daniel Aukin, Stereophonic Best Director of a Play \"David Adjmi told me he had an idea for a play in 2014. It was a really good idea. We knew that our Hayes, it wasn\u2019t going to be [an already big star] like Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet or someone, because there really aren\u2019t that many guys in that age range that are famous in that way. It was kind of more of a search, and we whittled it down to about 10. They all came to New York for a weekend, from all over the place, and we had a very intense sort of chemistry audition process with Anne. The guys came in and did scenes. We did some improvisation, they sang songs, they danced. It was pretty intense. I was really impressed by how professional and prepared and courageous these young guys were to come into that environment and really deliver. Michael Showalter: For me, it came as a script. I had not heard about the book. I was sent it as, this is a movie that is in development and has Anne Hathaway attached. I read the book subsequently. The script that made it to the screen has plenty of differences from the book. As you read the book, what were you thinking in terms of, how am I going to tell this story? I think the book is great. It\u2019s obviously not my genre. For me, it was like, there\u2019s a great version of this movie that\u2019s more like the book, [but] I\u2019m just not the right person to do that. So if you want me to do the movie, it would be a different kind of movie.

It is incredible to me to be able to have my name alongside these exceptional designers who I admire so much. To have my work on Water for Elephants recognized in such a way is such a wild feeling. I never imagined in my wildest dreams as a young boy in Mexico that I\u2019d get to experience something like this. This show has been such a phenomenal experience and I\u2019m so grateful to have been part of a team of such exceptional artists who inspired me to bring my best work. In the new play category, I'm elated to be one of three women nominated -- my research doesn't go that far back, but it must be deeply uncommon if not unprecedented for women playwrights to constitute the majority of new play nominees -- congrats to Jocelyn and Paula! And congratulations to all my fellow nominees, especially my current and past collaborators and all the other writers I've known, admired, studied with, been in writers' groups with, etc. I love seeing my generation of writers recognized for the theater's highest honors this year.

It\u2019s not a rom-com. Sometimes I hear myself say that it\u2019s a rom-com and I [really] don\u2019t feel at all like it is. It sort of starts out as a rom-com. There\u2019s actually things that happen pretty early on that signal that it\u2019s not, whether the audience is picking up on it or not. It\u2019s a pretty conventional setup: She\u2019s going to go take the daughter to Coachella, she goes to visit the ex-husband who\u2019s got the new younger wife, and then she goes back to her house and she\u2019s by herself in the house, and she\u2019s in the mirror taking her makeup off.

Consequently, by the time we\u2019d finished the first tour, the riffs which were coming out of these spaces, we were able to use for the immediate recording of the second album.

AFP/THOMAS COEX Rafael Nadal's family watched the match between Nadal and Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the ATP Masters 1000 Madrid tournament on Wednesday (1/5/2024) early morning WIB. The Madrid Masters has become one of the farewell tournaments for Nadal. He plans to retire in 2024, although he has not announced the end point of his 23-year journey as a professional tennis player. Lehecka came out firing in the second with an immediate break, and a marathon third game saw Nadal only just get on the scoreboard, denying the 22-year-old another three chances for a double break. The home favourite could not make any more inroads on the Lehecka serve, though, and on his opponent's first match point, Nadal sent a backhand just wide of the tramlines to confirm the end of his Madrid journey. Nadal confirms Madrid farewell in on-court interview As Lehecka rejoiced in setting up a last-eight encounter with Daniil Medvedev, Nadal - who missed out on a 100th ATP 1000 quarter-final - confirmed to the adoring crowd that he had competed in Madrid for the final time and claimed that playing for his home supporters trumped any of his 22 Grand Slam victories. Nadal spoke to the crowd after his final match in Madrid - Getty Images/Thomas Coex Rafael Nadal had to pause for a few moments, visibly emotional, while addressing the crowd after his loss in the fourth round at the Madrid Open. As chants of \u201cRafa, Rafa, Rafa\u201d echoed around, the five-time champion in Madrid made a farewell speech following a 7-5, 6-4 loss Tuesday to the 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka.

My body and my life had been sending me signs for some time,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI was able to say goodbye playing on this court, one of the most emotional ones for me.

Unite Here\u2019s role When the Petersburg City Council voted last Wednesday to pick Cordish, the body passed a lengthy resolution going public with the potentially explosive allegations against Aird and the General Assembly, accusing state politicians of essentially holding Petersburg\u2019s casino effort hostage in order to assert control over a process that was supposed to be run locally. In the city council\u2019s explanation, Altman only signed the letter to keep Petersburg\u2019s casino hopes alive in the state legislature. \u201d The report raised concerns about the finances of Bally\u2019s due to recent credit rating downgrades involving the company.

Smith, now a real estate developer after a storied football career that started at Virginia Tech, seemed to be under the impression it was the House speaker who was standing in the way of the Petersburg casino. In an interview with Virginia Business, Smith said \u201cnow\u2019s not the time to play politics with the people of Petersburg\u201d and made it clear he was directing those comments to Scott, according to an article that ran on April 12.

(KLKN) \u2013 Several tornadoes tore through Nebraska on Friday, including five in central Nebraska from the same two storms. Only four of them are on official record right now. An update from the National Weather Service of Omaha is expected to come later this afternoon regarding the tornadoes in eastern Nebraska. As of Monday morning, the Hastings office completed damage surveys that found five tornadoes \u2013 details of one will be released later as they confirm findings with the Omaha office due to its path crossing from Greeley to Boone counties (Hastings territory to Omaha territory). EF-1 NEAR RAVENNA The tornado that touched down near Ravenna was the first of the day and started near an ethanol plant. At 3:25 p. m. the National Weather Service canceled the tornado warning for Milam County as the rotation had exited the county to the northeast and into Robertson County. At that point, the Tornado Warning was back to being \u201cradar indicated\u201d as no recent sightings of the tornado were found. Minor damage According to the Milam County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the tornado caused only minor damage to a home in the Ben Arnold/Burlington area. The damage wasn\u2019t enough to force the homeowners out.

Tornado Watch: The environment is favorable for the development of tornadoes. Be prepared to seek shelter. The National Weather Service predicts it will remain active through Monday but only result in marginal risk. Tornado Emergency will be issued under the following criteria:. A well-built metal building was demolished with extensive damage to a nearby farm home. Based on the damage, this was where the strongest winds estimated at 145 mph occurred, giving the EF-3 rating to the tornado. The tornado was surveyed to be 600 yards wide as it crossed Highway 11 just northwest of Elba. A long stretch of power powers were knocked down along Odell Road. Elba Tornado Courtesy: NWS Hastings Elba Tornado Courtesy: NWS Hastings Elba Tornado Courtesy: NWS Hastings Elba Tornado Courtesy: NWS Hastings EF-2 NEAR WOLBACH The Elba tornado was said to have helped start the process for the formation of this next one near Wolbach. The tornado was said to be one of the widest of the day \u2013 at least a half mile wide at times. Attendees toted signs and wore traditional Palestinian keffiyehs, and tents were draped with Palestinian flags. At one point in the evening, students held a Passover Seder, complete with recitation of Jewish text and prayers. Students for Justice in Palestine, the campus activist group that spearheaded Sunday\u2019s protest, released a list of five demands for university administrators ahead of time. The group called on university leaders to reveal the details of financial investments made through its roughly $840 million endowment and divest funds from \u201call weapons manufacturers, Israeli companies, and companies involved in the occupation of historic Palestine. \u201d Activists demanded that the university institute a boycott of Israel\u2019s academic institutions and offer \u201camnesty for all students engaged in protests for Palestinian freedom, and a guarantee of no charges for protestors. \u201d And protesters called on UVM to cancel this year\u2019s commencement speaker, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, because of her vetoes of U. N. resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s the kind of person that represents our values as students at the University of Vermont and we don\u2019t think it would be befitting of the university to award her an honorary degree,\u201d said junior Trey Cook. Several students said they planned to attend protests planned for Monday afternoon, including Tatum Palmer, a first-year student. \u201cThis is a cause I really believe in,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is inherent to my values, and I don\u2019t think values are anything without direct action. \u201d The protests at UVM appeared peaceful Sunday. A large, old tree was completely uprooted. Dwayne Elam, who is the city\u2019s Public Works Director, said he noticed most of the trees damaged fell in a pattern to the northeast. An electrical pole snapped near the Sleepy Traveler Motel had lines fall over a truck. A tree in Maple Park snapped and fell between swing sets without damaging the swings. From 1:55 a. m. to 7:15 a. m. , Wagoner recorded a rain total of 2. 65 inches. In Coweta, there was no major damage reported, according to the city\u2019s PIO Mandy Vavrinak. They offered condolences and support for those in the district and beyond. \u201cMy prayers go out to the citizens of Sulphur, all of Murray County and those across the State of Oklahoma affected by the severe weather this weekend,\u201d McCall said. \u201cThe loss of life is the most precious thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what weighs so heavy on my heart. Everything else can be rebuilt. \u201d And in the spirit of rebuilding, McCall said an appropriation at the legislative level can still be made to help areas like Sulphur, which will lose sales tax revenue because of lost business, recover from the devastation. The situation is ongoing, and this post will be updated. .

General manager Les Snead and coach Sean McVay had said no single player could fill the void left by future-Hall-of-Famer Donald, so the Rams attempted to do it with volume. Four of 10 players the Rams selected in a draft that ended Saturday were defensive linemen, including first-round pick Jared Verse, an edge rusher from Florida State. Donald\u2019s departure left Los Angeles with a serious dearth of interior defensive linemen to play alongside promising nose tackle Kobie Turner. The Rams checked both of those boxes immediately in the draft, leaving them room to take the most appealing players with the rest of their picks. DEFENSE FIRST Los Angeles used five of its first six picks on defensive players, bolstering a unit that probably overachieved relative to its talent level by finishing 19th in the league. After Verse and Fiske, the Rams landed Miami safety Kamren Kinchens, a former first-team All-American, in the third round.

C. in Fallout 3 or gambling away your last couple of Caps on The Strip in Fallout: New Vegas, the series' North American setting is an essential piece of the puzzle. And while players have previously been given tantalising glimpses of how the rest of Bethesda's bleak world might be faring, studio head Todd Howard says the plan is to keep the series set in the US. The Fallout series retro-futuristic setting is littered with the remnants of US institutions, from The Enclave clinging onto some shreds of governmental authority to the cruel excesses of corporations like Vault-Tec. It's always been a savage satire of the concept of American exceptionalism, which just wouldn't feel right in other parts of the world. Which embarrassed me a little bit because I remember seeing Eddie Murphy on TV really pissed off about it. I had nothing against Eddie Murphy or Vanessa Redgrave. (Laughs) I just thought what [Dylan] was talking about was media overload and being slammed with so many things at once. And times were changing; there weren\u2019t four television channels anymore. It was changing, and that was the essence, I think, of what he was writing about. \u201d What is the Meaning of \u201cJammin\u2019 Me\u201d? Put aside the lines about those three stars and what you get is a typically idiosyncratic series of Dylan complaints about encroaching modernity (or at least modernity as it was in 1987). These hassles lead the narrator to feeling helplessly trapped: You got me in a corner / You got me against the wall, Petty sings to open the song. CNN \u2014 In recent years and with the rise of social media, fashion shows have become somewhat synonymous with broad spectacle. Just take a look at any of the major European labels\u2019 catwalk showcases, with elaborate, expensive sets, custom-built tents that can accommodate hundreds of guests, and thousands of fans screaming outside for the inevitable celebrity arrivals. Ralph Lauren wanted exactly none of that for his Fall/Holiday 2024 runway presentation last night in New York City. The designer instead looked inward to host something a bit more private, but no less impactful: he invited less than 100 guests to his design studio, nine floors above Madison Avenue. We caught up with Petty Theft guitarist Monroe Grisman as the band was finishing a slew of April gigs and preparing for yet another handful of May shows, including headlining Saturday\u2019s Bodega Bay festivities. Bohemian: Petty Theft has been together for 21 years now. That\u2019s quite an achievement for an original or tribute band. How many of the members were there from the beginning? Monroe Grisman: Our founding members are Django Bayless (bassist/vocals) and Dan Durkin (lead singer/acoustic guitar). In the early years, there was some turnover in the line-up before we settled into our core group, which has now been performing together for 16 years. Our newest member, Steven Seydler (keyboards), has been in the band for six years. \u201cAnd when they re-did the pier, he went to the Corps of Engineers and got the plaque back out and had them put it up,\u201d she said.

Premier League champions Manchester City are among the clubs described as \u2018in\u2019 for Bayer Leverkusen and Germany star midfielder Florian Wirtz, according to reports.

They're well aware of the challenges \u2014 and believe that generative AI could solve many of them without hastening their platforms' demise. In RPA vendors' minds, RPA and generative AI-powered agents can peacefully co-exist \u2014 and perhaps one day even grow to complement each other.

The three-day spectacle came to a close on Saturday and an injection of youth is now entering the league. For some clubs, they are hoping this young core can be the foundation they can rest their franchise on. For others, they could be looking to this class to be the final piece that pushes them over the top in their hunt for a Lombardi Trophy in 2024. While we are less than a week removed from the draft kicking off and we've yet to see any of these draftees play with their respective teams, we're going to dive into each AFC team and highlight their best, worst and most interesting selection. While it's unclear if he'll be their QB of the future, it's smart for them to start planning for the post-Rodgers era. Best pick (A): IOL Mason McCormick, South Dakota State (Round 4, Pick 119) Six-year player at FCS with four full years of starting experience and it shows. Elite-level athlete with low pad level. Grip strength is tremendous. Balance could use some work. Anchor is solid but overall has to get stronger. But this is an assignment sound blocker with ideal frame and experience to thrive instantly. Love how Pittsburgh has rebuilt its OL. (Chris Trapasso) Worst pick (B-): DL Logan Lee, Iowa (Round 6, Pick 178) Vintage Steelers pick here. High-caliber athlete who can win at any alignment up front although his productivity in college didn't match how good of an athlete he is. The team traded down from the No. 28 overall pick and allowed the Chiefs to trade Xavier Worthy. Then, they traded down again from No. 32 to allow the Panthers to select Xavier Legette. Those receivers will specifically be linked to the Bills and Coleman throughout his tenure. In any event, he has an opportunity to adopt a ton of targets left by Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis. Best pick (A): EDGE Cedric Johnson, Ole Miss (Round 6, Pick 214) Stocky defensive end with dynamic flashes. Love his swipe move, just wished he utilized it more frequently. Powerful player who has to be coached up on how to utilize his length better to keep blockers off him. Ascending rusher. I like this pick. But it\u2019s at least worth asking why Alabama didn\u2019t do that last year, with true freshman Kadyn Proctor having wound up on the left side. That said, Bill Callahan moved Jedrick Wills Jr. , another Bama guy, from right to left tackle after Cleveland took him in the first round in 2020, and it\u2019s usually a good idea to trust the venerable line coach on this stuff. \u2022 Obviously, Jayden Daniels\u2019s success or failure will determine how we view the Washington Commanders\u2019 class. But I\u2019m really impressed that they were able to come out of the second round with Illinois DT Jer\u2019Zhan \u201cJohnny\u201d Newton, Michigan slot CB Mike Sainristil and Kansas State TE Ben Sinnott. Can cover tight ends. Deliver big hits over the middle. Make plays on the football with decent regularity. And he tackles well. Awesome addition to Chiefs secondary. Best closer to the line of scrimmage. My top safety in this class. (Chris Trapasso) Worst pick (B): OT Kingsley Suamataia, BYU (Round 2, Pick 64) Boom-or-burst prospect. 2022 was outstanding 2023 was not on film. Burst and especially lateral sliding ability are there. Has hard time locking onto EDGEs and securing them. Slips out of many blocks against the run. Hand work in pass pro can be outstanding at times. Raw but talented. NFL OT frame. Need filled. Thick frame. Block-shedding skills are well-developed but has no pass-rush plans. Active on passing downs just rarely gets home. Length is a plus and he's an above-average athlete for a future NT. Not a bad player just limited and this feels early. (Chris Trapasso) Most interesting pick (B+): WR Brian Thomas Jr. , LSU (Round 1, Pick 23) Thomas Jr. seemed to be in a tier of his own in this draft class. He was looking up to the likes of Marvin Harrison Jr. , Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze, but a tick above the next group. Now that he joins Trevor Lawrence in Jacksonville, I think there's an outside chance that he could be of the bigger impact receivers in this draft, including the Big 3 who went above him. The 6-foot-4, 255 pounder followed that up with a 2023 season where he caught 41 balls for 576 yards and five scores. Dalton Schultz is the TE1 in this offense at the moment and signed through 2026, but Stover could be a factor in short time. Best pick (A): WR Adonai Mitchell, Texas (Round 2, Pick 52) Love this pick for Colts. Exactly the type they like. Size/speed/athleticism specimen. So fluid running routes. Just can have long stretches where he goes invisible. Very minimal YAC. An outside wideout who can win at second and third levels for Anthony Richardson. (Chris Trapasso) Worst pick (C): EDGE Jonah Laulu, Oklahoma (Round 7, Pick 234) Tall, somewhat sleek interior rusher with great length. Both first-round edge Laiatu Latu and second-round WR Adonai Mitchell came with red flags. Both could be huge hits for GM Chris Ballard, or go the other way. Regardless, these are swings for the fences such as the selection of Anthony Richardson a year ago. \u2022 Sometimes you hear stuff leading up to the draft that winds up coming true on Thursday night\u2014and such was the case with the Jacksonville Jaguars, who did a ton of work on the receivers over the past two months. It matches, too, with how far they were willing to go to keep Calvin Ridley, even with contracts for Christian Kirk and Gabe Davis on the ledger. So they\u2019re committed to improving the skill-position talent around Trevor Lawrence. Now they just have to hope Brian Thomas Jr. Ezekiel Elliott showed that he could still play during his time with the New England Patriots. Apparently, it was enough for the Dallas Cowboys to come calling to bring him home. According to NFL Network, the Cowboys have agreed to a deal to bring Elliott back into the fold down in Dallas. A three-time Pro Bowler and two-time rushing champ, Elliott quickly rose to stardom in Dallas after the team drafted him in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft.

The QB was elected team captain twice and earned praise for maintaining a stoic demeanor despite the weak protection he got from his offensive line. Pete Thamel noted that there were concerns over the player\u2019s \u201cintangibles\u201d from his time with the Sooners, especially after he was benched in favor of Caleb Williams. Click on \u2018Follow Us\u2019 and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google! Follow Us \u201cThere are questions about his work ethic, questions about his attitude and you have to ask the question if you draft him: Can you trust him to come in and be a backup?\u201d Thamel wondered. The Denver Broncos found their quarterback in the 2024 NFL Draft and like five other teams, they did so early. The run on quarterbacks in the first round set the pace for this year's selection process and likely changed the strategy of many teams. Sean Payton can say what he wants after the fact, but had Michael Penix Jr. and J. J. McCarthy still been on the board at No. 12 overall, he would not have drafted Bo Nix. Spencer Rattler was the quarterback who fell completely down the board after six quarterbacks went in the first 12 picks before finally being chosen by the New Orleans Saints in the fifth round. But speaking on the Pat McAfee Show on Monday, ESPN's Adam Schefter said that two teams were very high on Rattler. Those two teams were Atlanta and Denver. The New Orleans Saints ended up with a very intriguing quarterback in the middle of the 2024 NFL draft as they selected South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler with the No. 150 overall selection in the fifth round. Rattler, once the best pro-style quarterback out of high school, had a very contentious college career that landed him as a project player instead of a first-round guy. He famously had his own fans calling for him to be benched in favor of Caleb Williams at Oklahoma. He then transferred to South Carolina where he was able to actually revive his career a good bit. He\u2019s played a lot of football and would probably be able to handle managing a system in an emergency situation. That\u2019s likely the only type of situation that you would see him in, so expectations shouldn\u2019t be very high. Now, he has a chance to impress Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and his coaching staff to hopefully land on the roster. Want to join the discussion?

Ezekiel Elliott showed that he could still play during his time with the New England Patriots. Apparently, it was enough for the Dallas Cowboys to come calling to bring him home. According to NFL Network, the Cowboys have agreed to a deal to bring Elliott back into the fold down in Dallas. A three-time Pro Bowler and two-time rushing champ, Elliott quickly rose to stardom in Dallas after the team drafted him in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He spent the 2023 season in New England playing alongside Rhamondre Stevenson. Fanatics Sportsbook 10X$100 BONUS BET BET MATCH BONUS CLAIM OFFER Must be 21+. GAMBLING PROBLEM?

He also earned an All-Big 12 First-Team selection during his time at Oklahoma State. Unfortunately, Sanders was a part of the 2022 transfer portal madness that ensued in Stillwater. The grass wasn't greener at Ole Miss, though, as Sanders took a backseat to Jaxon Dart, playing very, very minimally during the 2023 college football season. Sanders has a chance to join the Chiefs roster, should he impress at the minicamp, posing a big opportunity. Playing behind three-time Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes, who has led the Chiefs to back-to-back Super Bowl victories, is a perfect opportunity for Sanders to learn from an NFL legend-in-the-making. The Chiefs added Carson Wentz to back up Mahomes after struggling in the backup department in recent years, but Sanders would add more youth and depth to the room. Cole Bishop, S, Utah For a variety of reasons, Bishop heading to Buffalo is intriguing. The Bills drafted him with the 60th overall selection in the second round, a spot the talented former Ute had been linked to in a variety of mock drafts. For starters, he\u2019s reuniting with former Utah teammate Dalton Kincaid, a 2023 first-rounder who made a big impact as a rookie at tight end. \u201cI got to meet with them a couple of times during the combine \u2026 then having a couple Zooms throughout the process with my guy Dalton out there. I was always hoping that that would be a possibility. So super awesome when I got that call,\u201d Bishop said during his introductory press conference.

They chose quarterbacks. That is what led to Rattler's freefall. But if you ask me, the Saints got a huge bargain when they chose the former Oklahoma and South Carolina quarterback. The Broncos ended up with Nix and Payton spoke glowingly of him and that pick. But what is more likely is that the team got spooked when Penix went at No. 8 and McCarthy went at No. 10 and they wanted to ensure that they got a quarterback, rather than rolling the dice and not getting one at all, which could have happened..\n\nQuestion: What does Spencer Rattler aim to prove as he joins this NFL team?\nAnswers:\nA.

Messi scored in both halves to lead the Herons to another win as Tata Martino's men continue to lead the way in the Eastern Conference with a 6-3-2 record. Messi got his eighth and ninth goals of the young season as he continues to climb his way up the club's all-time scoring ranks with Gonzalo Higuan's 29 goals in sight this season. But while the end result was solid for the visitors, the game couldn't have started off worse. It was the defensive woes from a team that has invested mostly in an attack that appeared early. Tickets to catch a glimpse of the Argentinian delight set fans back at $285 a piece, $10 more than the average ticket for a 2023 New England Patriots home game. Messi\u2019s dual record-breaking performance comes on the heels of him playing at another sold-out stadium at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, where Miami won, 3-2, against Sporting KC. After Saturday\u2019s win, Inter Miami sits first in the Eastern Conference with a 6-3-2 record. Messi, who bagged his eighth and ninth goals of the season, is chasing Gonzalo Higuain\u2019s all-time scoring record for the club (29); he currently reigns as the top scorer in the MLS with nine goals in seven games. \u201cPeople come to every stadium to see Leo, that\u2019s true, but they also want their team to win,\u201d Miami coach Gerardo Martino said Saturday. To that point, the only recorded shot on goal for New England throughout the game was Chancalay\u2019s goal in the opening minute. Miami, meanwhile, were perfectly comfortable to move the ball around the field methodically for much of the night. This slower tempo was interrupted by small moments in which Messi \u2014 idle for much of the game \u2014 burst to life seemingly out of nowhere. This phenomenon, coupled with the years-long chemistry he has with fellow former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets, resulted in the second Miami goal.

The magic of Messi Mania entranced a sold-out crowd at Gillette Stadium, as over 65,000 wide-eyed soccer fans watched the Argentinian superstar make an iconic piece of MLS history. In Inter Miami\u2019s 4-1 win over the New England Revolution on Saturday, Lionel Messi became the first MLS player to record multiple goal contributions (goals or assists) in five straight matches. His 16 goal contributions is also the most by any MLS player in the first seven games of a season, surpassing Thierry Henry and Carlos Vela, who each had 13 in that span. The one-time World Cup winner scored the first two goals for his team and also assisted former Barcelona teammate Luis Suarez\u2019s goal in the 88th minute. FOXBOROUGH \u2015 Almost eight years ago, nearly 60,000 soccer fans descended on Gillette Stadium to see Lionel Messi play his first match in New England. On that day, Messi netted two assists and scored the go-ahead goal to guide Argentina past Venezuela out of the quarterfinals of the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario. Fast forward to Saturday and Messi did it again, scoring twice and notching an assist to fuel Inter Miami past the New England Revolution, 4-1, in front of a record-breaking 65,612 fans. Tomas Chancalay gave the hosts an early jolt of energy when he got on the end of a perfectly-weighted lofted pass from Carles Gil. It would last just over half an hour before Messi did what he does -- score goals. His eighth goal of the season came in the 32nd minute when he was played into the box and finished easily at the near post in front of 65,000 fans. In the second half, it was more of the same as Sergio Busquets managed to thread the needle with a stellar through ball, feeding Messi in the box for a nifty finish to the other post. Benjamin Cremaschi added Inter Miami's third with seven minutes to go to cement the win before Luis Suarez scored in the 88th. Next up for the Herons, they return to action on Saturday against the New York Red Bulls. The Revs fed off Chancalay\u2019s goal and looked likely to score again, but with a player of Messi\u2019s caliber in their lineup, Miami remained as dangerous as ever. Messi registered his first shot on target in the 30th minute before delivering for the visitors soon after in the 32nd minute. Robert Taylor made a strong but successful challenge on Matt Polser, dispossessing him on the edge of the box inside the Revs\u2019 half. Taylor quickly played Messi into the box and without missing a beat, Messi took a touch to control before firing the ball into the bottom right-hand corner.

Messi registered his first shot on target in the 30th minute before delivering for the visitors soon after in the 32nd minute. Robert Taylor made a strong but successful challenge on Matt Polser, dispossessing him on the edge of the box inside the Revs\u2019 half.

Let\u2019s take it a step further and look into the tape to see what the Lions are getting with Giovanni Manu from British Columbia! Starting with the first play, you can see Giovanni Manu aligned as the left tackle (#76) for the British Columbia offense. Immediately, you\u2019ll notice how flexible his lower half is with good knee bend. This helps him lower his pad level and work his hands into the defenders chest plate. Once the ball is snapped, you\u2019ll see relatively quick feet from Manu in his kick-slide. This helps him mirror defenders off the edge. Most importantly, you can see the biggest asset to his game with his grip strength. Manu grew up in Tonga -- a Pacific island about a 45-minute flight from American Samoa, which produced Sewell -- before moving to Canada in search of better educational opportunities at 11 years old. Then he packed on a half-foot and about 80 pounds between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, and tried his hand at basketball before eventually making his way to football.

Rang especially praised Brenden Rice's \"blend of savvy route-running and strong, secure hands\" that he characterized as similar to Jerry's.

Braelon Allen flashed a polite smile and had a short laugh when asked a question at the University of Wisconsin pro day. The query was if Allen had considered staying in college and playing for the Badgers for one more season. Name, image and likeness money has made the prospect of extra college seasons a bit more attractive, and the fewest underclassmen since 2011 entered the NFL Draft, per a report from The Associated Press. But Allen\u2019s answer regarding his stance on the subject was telling. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. Reaching the NFL was Allen\u2019s goal from an early age and he took multiple steps throughout his life to hasten his matriculation. This weekend\u2019s draft culminated and validated the challenges he took on to reach this moment. McCormick helped lead South Dakota State to back-to-back FCS National Championships. He is the third offensive lineman to be selected by Pittsburgh, joining Washington's Troy Fautanu and West Virginia's Zach Frazier. RELATED: South Dakota State OL Mason McCormick Scouting Report. \u201cHe\u2019s starting to come to life even more. And then really later on in the process, just sticking to the special teams component, it kind of came to life even more with some possible return value. You\u2019re looking at him at four corps in the return units as more of a blocker, but the stuff that he can do with the ball in his hands (is appealing). I first saw him when he had first made the switch when they got kind of short at running back there at Utah. They just had him fill in. But we were more so looking at him as a safety, but he looks so natural as a runner. Bell spent his first three seasons of college ball at South Carolina, and racked up 95 receptions for 1,260 yards and nine touchdowns (plus four more rushing scores) over his four years. Williams spent two seasons at quarterback and once ran for 192 yards in a game, a school record for a QB. Moved to receiver for his final three seasons and led the team in receiving each of those years. Led the Big Ten with 82 catches this past year, racked up 1,055 yards and was named first-team All-Big Ten as a wideout, plus earned honorable mention for his work as a punt returner. The return ability should be appealing to Detroit.

Add this group to last year\u2019s draft class, and hopefully we get moving. \u201d That\u2019s exactly what the goal should be right now. The Raiders could have mortgaged their future for one of the top three quarterbacks, but is the rest of the roster really in place to allow someone like Jayden Daniels to have immediate success? Probably not. This is an organization that has tried quick fixes far too many times. Far too often, the hefty hacks at the plate have resulted in whiffs. That\u2019s why the Raiders have been stuck right at or below. Via Doug Farrar: The Miami Dolphins are the football answer to the conceptual question: What if they built the entire plane out of the black box? There is no mystery at all to what Mike McDaniel wants to do on offense \u2014 he wants to put a track team on the field to terrify your defense with the home-run play every single time. To that end, they got Jalen Wright, one of the most explosive backs in this class, who can also get grimy yards to a degree. And I don\u2019t know how they stole Malik Washington in the sixth round, but adding his house-call speed to this thing could be ridiculous. And I really like Patrick Paul as a plus pass-blocker. But what Miami did on defense is just as interesting \u2014 they went with speed here, as well. 87: Marist Liufau, LB, Notre Dame Round 5: No. 174: Caelen Carson, CB, Wake Forest Round 6: No. 216: Ryan Flournoy, WR, SE Missouri State Round 7: No. 233: Nathan Thomas, OT, Louisiana Round 7: No. 244: Justin Rogers, DT, Auburn Analysis: We discussed this on the MMQB podcast , but Dallas\u2019s continued insistence on behaving and drafting like a team that has already won something of consequence is puzzling. Guyton may have the highest upside of any tackle in this class, but owner Jerry Jones has to consider who benefits from a longer-term project when everyone on his staff is being held to the fire this year.

We\u2019re not going to celebrate making the playoffs, that\u2019s going to be the expectation. \u201d Although his support staff, including offensive and defensive coordinators, have yet to be set, Schultz did say he will implement a new offense \u2013 the flexbone triple option \u2013 while installing a 3-4 schemed defense. Both are relatively stark changes from the program\u2019s last regime, which saw mostly spread concepts on offense and a 5-2 look on defense. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to look a little more like my Year 3 at Centreville where we threw the ball more and I\u2019m hoping to be a balanced flexbone with a little more play action,\u201d Schultz said. The Kansas State men\u2019s basketball team is going to look a lot different next season. Of course, that is nothing new for Jerome Tang. Tang hasn\u2019t enjoyed any semblance of roster continuity since the Wildcats hired him as their head coach in 2022. He famously inherited just two returning players from the Bruce Weber era before his first year. That number rose up to six heading into Year 2. But he will welcome back no more than three returning players as he once again looks to rebuild ahead of the 2024-25 campaign. A busy week of transfers (incoming and outgoing) plus other roster transactions have once again left the Wildcats in a state of flux. Here\u2019s where things currently stand. Rutgers big man Clifford Omoruyi is considering the Wildcats, and so is Florida State forward Baba Miller. Khalif Battle, a 6-foot-5 guard from Arkansas, is also considering K-State. Expect Tang to continue exploring other transfer options for as long as it takes to assemble a full roster. He has waited to add several players in the summer months. The Wildcats will find a way to fit a bunch of new pieces together before next season arrives. This is not new for them. Ohio State men\u2019s basketball head coach Jake Diebler has announced the hiring of assistant coach Luke Simons. Simons joins the program with eight years of collegiate experience and another seven of international experience. \u201cI\u2019m excited to welcome Luke as he\u2019s going to be a great addition to our staff,\u201d Diebler said. \u201cHe has the ability to connect with players at every level and his versatility is really important. He\u2019s been on staff at the collegiate level, and he has international coaching experience as well. Those experiences are going to be valuable for our program as we move forward. \u201d Simons comes to Columbus after spending the previous two seasons as the director of basketball operations at Baylor. In Simons\u2019 two years at Baylor, the Bears won 47 games and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament each season. The other outgoing transfers are Cam Carter (LSU), Dorian Finister (Sam Houston State) and Jerrell Colbert. Arthur Kaluma also announced last week that he will declare for the NBA Draft. Add on the losses of Tylor Perry, Will McNai and Taymont Lindsey, who are all out of college eligibility, and Tang has been left with no choice but to bring in a transfer-heavy recruiting class this offseason. Transfers have become commonplace in college basketball, so several other teams are dealing with the exact same situation as the Wildcats. But Tang spoke about creating a culture that limited transfers at his introductory news conference. This isn\u2019t what he had in mind back then. The good news for both Tang and the Wildcats is that they have found some early success in the portal. Church also spent time as assistant coach at Florida Southern and Saint Joseph\u2019s.

I am looking forward to seeing him take our program to new heights. \u201d Church takes over for Lonnie Griffin, who resigned following the 2023-24 campaign in which the Timberwolves posted a 7-14 overall record with a 4-16 mark in GMAC play. \u201cI am honored to be named the next head men\u2019s basketball coach at Northwood University,\u201d Church said in the press release. \u201cMy family and I are excited to become part of the Midland community and Northwood family.

He averaged 19. 1 points, 8. 91 rebounds, 2. 1 assists and 1. 6 steals per game in his senior season, according to KCHSHoops. com. I think there\u2019s a lot of good in this community. \u201d So, how does Schultz plan on rectifying the program? It starts with building relationships \u2013\u2013 something that\u2019s always came natural to him. \u201cWe have to trust each other, and when you have that trust, you can go as far as you want,\u201d said Schultz, a longtime teacher and the current dean of students for Centreville Public Schools. \u201cDuring that 2020 season at Centreville when it was COVID, I\u2019m doing everything via Zoom. Kids are hearing they won\u2019t have a season and I\u2019m having to build that trust and tell them that \u2018listen, it will happen. \u2019 \u201cThat trust piece leads to more success on the field. \u201d Once that\u2019s in order, Schultz didn\u2019t mince his words on what the expectation for Mattawan is moving forward: excellence in the classroom and annual playoff appearances. Period. \u201cI am honored to be named the next head men\u2019s basketball coach at Northwood University,\u201d Church said in the press release. \u201cMy family and I are excited to become part of the Midland community and Northwood family. We are going to establish a standard within our program that everyone can be proud of both on and off the court. \u201d Church guided Tiffin to some of its finest moments during his six-year stay with the Dragons. He led the program to its first postseason berth in 21 years while earning GMAC Coach of the Year in 2022-23 then oversaw an 18-win campaign last season that was Tiffin\u2019s most in 25 years. He served as head coach at Saint Joseph\u2019s College from 2013-17, improving its win total each season. MIDLAND, MI \u2013 Northwood University found the new leader of its men\u2019s basketball program from within the conference, introducing Tom Church as head coach on Monday. Church makes the move from fellow Great Midwest Athletic Conference program Tiffin University, where he was named GMAC Coach of the Year in 2023. \u201cWe are thrilled to bring in a coach of Tom\u2019s caliber to our men\u2019s basketball program,\u201d Northwood athletic director Jeff Curtis said via press release. \u201cHis track record of success at the Division II level made him the best person for the job in a group of outstanding candidates. I am looking forward to seeing him take our program to new heights. \u201d Church takes over for Lonnie Griffin, who resigned following the 2023-24 campaign in which the Timberwolves posted a 7-14 overall record with a 4-16 mark in GMAC play. The other outgoing transfers are Cam Carter (LSU), Dorian Finister (Sam Houston State) and Jerrell Colbert. Arthur Kaluma also announced last week that he will declare for the NBA Draft. Add on the losses of Tylor Perry, Will McNai and Taymont Lindsey, who are all out of college eligibility, and Tang has been left with no choice but to bring in a transfer-heavy recruiting class this offseason. Transfers have become commonplace in college basketball, so several other teams are dealing with the exact same situation as the Wildcats. But Tang spoke about creating a culture that limited transfers at his introductory news conference. This isn\u2019t what he had in mind back then. The good news for both Tang and the Wildcats is that they have found some early success in the portal. Ohio State men\u2019s basketball head coach Jake Diebler has announced the hiring of assistant coach Luke Simons. Simons joins the program with eight years of collegiate experience and another seven of international experience. \u201cI\u2019m excited to welcome Luke as he\u2019s going to be a great addition to our staff,\u201d Diebler said. \u201cHe has the ability to connect with players at every level and his versatility is really important. He\u2019s been on staff at the collegiate level, and he has international coaching experience as well. Those experiences are going to be valuable for our program as we move forward. \u201d Simons comes to Columbus after spending the previous two seasons as the director of basketball operations at Baylor. In Simons\u2019 two years at Baylor, the Bears won 47 games and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament each season. The Kansas State men\u2019s basketball team is going to look a lot different next season. Of course, that is nothing new for Jerome Tang. Tang hasn\u2019t enjoyed any semblance of roster continuity since the Wildcats hired him as their head coach in 2022. He famously inherited just two returning players from the Bruce Weber era before his first year. That number rose up to six heading into Year 2. But he will welcome back no more than three returning players as he once again looks to rebuild ahead of the 2024-25 campaign. A busy week of transfers (incoming and outgoing) plus other roster transactions have once again left the Wildcats in a state of flux. Here\u2019s where things currently stand. If we\u2019re sending blitzes, there\u2019s a purpose behind it. \u201d Schultz\u2019s teams have always shined defensively, especially his 2020 state championship team, where his defense allowed an eye-popping 2. 6 points per game. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting defense for them and just like the offense, there\u2019s a lot of movement,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity for different guys to get the ball so I think they\u2019ll be excited. It\u2019s very similar to what Portage Central is running but I think ours will have a little bit different flair. \u201d Schultz, a 2006 Penn High School grad, said he\u2019ll still reside in Three Rivers with his wife, Amy, and 9-year-old son, Henry, for the time being, but his son will transfer into Mattawan following the conclusion of this school year. Simons spent nearly a decade as a coach and regional coordinator with Athletes in Action, created to help athletes to use their platform as a part of God\u2019s mission. During his time with AIA, he served an integral role in assembling and directing multiple international competitive tours throughout Europe and Asia. Additionally, he created Captains Academy, an AIA leadership initiative to serve influencers specifically in the sport of basketball. The Shelbyville, Ind. , native is a graduate of Purdue University with a bachelor's degree in movement and sports science. Luke Simons\u2019 Coaching Career 2024-Pres. Church also spent time as assistant coach at Florida Southern and Saint Joseph\u2019s. A four-year player at Ashland University, Church was named team captain in 2003.

If you are a former governor and you have nothing to contribute to Benue, shut up. \u201d While reacting to the governor\u2019s warning, the Tiv socio-cultural group, in a statement signed by its President, Comrade Yoosu Sooter Daniel, criticized Alia for running the state like a parish house and turning around to blame his predecessors for his failures. He said, \u201cHow could Governor Alia, who has frozen the state\u2019s accounts thereby paralyzing day-to-day running of government, accuse his predecessors of interfering in his government? ALSO READ: FCSC chairman pledges to support Wike in institutionalising FCT civil service \u201cThe governor has been solely responsible for the actions and inaction of his government, thereby creating a rift between him and his party, the All Progressives Congress, APC. \u201cHow then does he find it convenient to accuse his predecessors of interference?\u201d the group asked. The group also alleged that Ayabam\u2019s first tenure as BIRS Chairman ushered in the existence of illegal check points on Benue roads. The group also pointed out that Ayabam\u2019s second coming as BIRS Chairman saw the emergence of not less than 17 illegal check points in his Ushongo Local Government Area, LGA. It further alleged that Ayabam\u2019s second tenure also saw the significant drop in revenue, thereby affecting Benue\u2019s share of FAAC, which affected the funds available to the state for development. BAFAN also disclosed that Ayabam\u2019s tenure as BIRS Chairman is often characterized by the establishment of many branches of his business empire which began to decline shortly after he left office, purchase of landed property all over Benue State, amongst others. Criticisms both on me and my administration are very much welcome but check and verify your facts before putting them out to the public bearing in mind that words have consequences. \u201d But while responding to the governor, the TYPF, in a statement issued by its President, Comrade Yoosu Daniel, condemned him for allegedly running the \u2018state like a parish house and turning around to blame his predecessors for his failures. \u2019 \u201cHow could Governor Alia who has frozen the state\u2019s accounts thereby paralyzing day to day running of government accuse his predecessors of interfering in his government?\u201d, the group queried. \u201cThe Governor has been solely responsible for the actions and inaction of his government, thereby creating a rift between him and his party, the All Progressives Congress, APC.

Hopkins is being pressured by the protestors to cut ties with Tel-Aviv University in Israel, where a two-year Master of Arts program partnership was established in recent years. Demonstrators initially said they would not leave until their demands were met, but Johns Hopkins University released a statement Tuesday saying an agreement was made with students: \"At Hopkins, we have longstanding policies and guidelines to support demonstration and free expression. These guidelines were developed collaboratively with our students and reflect a mutual commitment to the flow of open, vibrant expression that is so essential to our academic community, and to preventing harassment, discrimination, or intimidation.

About 300 pro-Palestinian demonstrators took part on the protest. Credit: AP Tuesday\u2019s protests came days after pro-Palestinian students, inspired by Gaza solidarity encampments at campuses in the United States, staged protests and tried to occupy campus buildings at France\u2019s two prestigious universities in the Paris region. On Monday, French police removed 50 students from the Sorbonne university after pro-Palestinian protesters occupied the main courtyard. Last week, protests broke out at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, known as Sciences Po, as pro-Palestinian students attempted to occupy an amphitheater. On Friday, pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators faced each other in a tense standoff in the street outside the school. Riot police stepped in to separate the opposing groups.

This statement marks Carter\u2019s first direct response to the arrests that took place at Tuesday\u2019s and Thursday\u2019s on-campus protests. Carter said the arrests were not in retaliation to protesters exercising their right to free speech, but rather an enforcement of the university\u2019s space rules, which prohibit certain activities on Ohio State\u2019s campuses including encampments and excessive noise. \u201cI value and welcome free speech.

Pro-Palestinian protests at universities in the United States have resulted in approximately 600 student arrests at 15 college campuses across the country. Most of the arrests have occurred at encampments and sit-in demonstrations, with students demanding their universities divest from Israeli businesses and cut ties with universities in Israel in opposition to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian supporters hold up a sign and flag inside an encampment on the UCLA campus Friday, April 26, 2024, in Los Angeles. As the death toll mounts in the war in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis worsens, protesters at universities across the country are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies they say are enabling the conflict. To date, more than 34,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military offensive against Hamas. The conflict has not only caused a humanitarian catastrophe but also spilled over to other parts of the region, dragging more parties into the fray. At present, apart from losing the moral high ground because of its callous support of Israel's relentless military offensive in Gaza the US itself is feeling a strong backlash from what it has sowed in the Middle East: Many university campuses in the US are convulsed in chaos as students stage pro-Palestine protests. Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested amid allegations of police brutality, all triggered by the US' lopsided policy on the ongoing conflict. While Emory University hasn\u2019t seen any arrests so far this weekend amid the ongoing war protests (after arrests that were made Thursday at the metro Atlanta campus), the demonstrations at some college campuses weren\u2019t peaceful. More than 200 protesters were arrested Saturday at Northeastern University, Arizona State University, Indiana University and Washington University in St. Louis, according to officials, as colleges across the country struggle to quell growing pro-Palestinian demonstrations and encampments on campus. The New York Times reported that more than 700 protesters have been arrested on U. S. campuses since April 18, when Columbia University had the New York Police Department clear a protest encampment there. In several cases, most of those who were arrested have been released. At Washington University in St. This is not normal. This is not pro peace. And this surely is not progressive. This is dangerous. \u201d Baker highlighted Khymani James, a former Boston School Committee student representative, now a leader of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University calling for the eradication of Zionists. Late Friday, Columbia University announced it had barred James from campus. The university did not make clear if he was suspended or permanently expelled. Patriots owner Robert Kraft sent a video message shown during the rally, expressing his support. Last week, Kraft pulled his support for his alma mater Columbia amid the explosion of anti-Israel \u201cvirulent hate\u201d protests on campus. Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, founder and president of Harvard Chabad, pointed to the showdown at the Emerson encampment, thanking law enforcement and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for attempting to make Jewish students feel safe. As encampments spring up at college campuses across Greater Boston and the nation, Jewish students say they continue to feel terrified, in danger and alone amid the Israel-Hamas war and the protests that have erupted around it. Hundreds of parents, professors and members of the community at large stood in solidarity with students who are grappling with antisemitic rhetoric and harassment at their schools during an hour-long rally Sunday at Temple Israel of Boston. Students and supporters conveyed a central message: Through the trauma that comes their way, they\u2019ll remain committed to eradicating hatred and violence toward Jews and celebrating Jewish pride and joy. Rallygoers held signs that on one side read \u201cBoston stands against antisemitism,\u201d and the other \u201cNo hate on our campuses. \u201d Dozens held American and Israeli flags, with flags draped around others\u2019 backs. Israeli songs also played, with the crowd singing along. \u201d Over the past week, encampments at Emerson, Northeastern, Harvard, Tufts and MIT have dominated the local headlines. Nationally, Columbia University in New York City has been at the center of college unrest. That\u2019s where Lishi Baker, a Brookline native and Columbia sophomore, said he has been told that he and fellow Jewish classmates are all \u201cinbred\u201d and that \u201cwe have no culture. \u201d Baker, son of Mark Baker, the president and CEO of Combined Jewish Philanthropies which organized Sunday\u2019s rally, said \u201cno one seemed to listen\u201d to concerns from Jewish students over some of the messages that pro-Palestinian students have chanted during protests. \u201cWe have been told to go back to Europe, to go back to Poland,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThree of my friends were physically assaulted inside the campus gates.

Nationally, Columbia University in New York City has been at the center of college unrest. That\u2019s where Lishi Baker, a Brookline native and Columbia sophomore, said he has been told that he and fellow Jewish classmates are all \u201cinbred\u201d and that \u201cwe have no culture. \u201d Baker, son of Mark Baker, the president and CEO of Combined Jewish Philanthropies which organized Sunday\u2019s rally, said \u201cno one seemed to listen\u201d to concerns from Jewish students over some of the messages that pro-Palestinian students have chanted during protests. \u201cWe have been told to go back to Europe, to go back to Poland,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThree of my friends were physically assaulted inside the campus gates. In a growing number of college campuses throughout the country, student protesters are setting up tent encampments on school grounds to call for a ceasefire in Gaza and for their schools to divest from Israeli companies. (Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) Columbia\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik , faced a significant, but largely symbolic, rebuke from faculty Friday but retains the support of trustees, who have the power to hire or fire the president. A report by the university senate\u2019s executive committee, which represents faculty, found Shafik and her administration took \"many actions and decisions that have harmed Columbia University,\" including calling in police. Following the report, the senate passed a resolution that included a task force to monitor how the administration would make changes going forward. This is not normal. This is not pro peace. And this surely is not progressive. This is dangerous. \u201d Baker highlighted Khymani James, a former Boston School Committee student representative, now a leader of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University calling for the eradication of Zionists. Late Friday, Columbia University announced it had barred James from campus. The university did not make clear if he was suspended or permanently expelled. Patriots owner Robert Kraft sent a video message shown during the rally, expressing his support. Last week, Kraft pulled his support for his alma mater Columbia amid the explosion of anti-Israel \u201cvirulent hate\u201d protests on campus. Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, founder and president of Harvard Chabad, pointed to the showdown at the Emerson encampment, thanking law enforcement and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for attempting to make Jewish students feel safe. As encampments spring up at college campuses across Greater Boston and the nation, Jewish students say they continue to feel terrified, in danger and alone amid the Israel-Hamas war and the protests that have erupted around it. Hundreds of parents, professors and members of the community at large stood in solidarity with students who are grappling with antisemitic rhetoric and harassment at their schools during an hour-long rally Sunday at Temple Israel of Boston. Students and supporters conveyed a central message: Through the trauma that comes their way, they\u2019ll remain committed to eradicating hatred and violence toward Jews and celebrating Jewish pride and joy. Rallygoers held signs that on one side read \u201cBoston stands against antisemitism,\u201d and the other \u201cNo hate on our campuses. \u201d Dozens held American and Israeli flags, with flags draped around others\u2019 backs. Israeli songs also played, with the crowd singing along. The institute\u2019s museum, which is located in the building where the demonstrators set up camp, was closed Friday. The school\u2019s commencement was still scheduled for May 22 and May 23.

(Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu Expand INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON After an encampment was set up at Indiana University Bloomington, police with shields and batons shoved into a line of protesters linked arm-in-arm Thursday afternoon. Videos posted to social media appear to show the protest continuing after law enforcement stopped making arrests. In an update Friday, the university police said 34 people were arrested. Pro-Palestinian protests at universities in the United States have resulted in approximately 600 student arrests at 15 college campuses across the country. Most of the arrests have occurred at encampments and sit-in demonstrations, with students demanding their universities divest from Israeli businesses and cut ties with universities in Israel in opposition to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian supporters hold up a sign and flag inside an encampment on the UCLA campus Friday, April 26, 2024, in Los Angeles. As the death toll mounts in the war in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis worsens, protesters at universities across the country are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies they say are enabling the conflict. More college campus protest arrests over war in Gaza, tensions spill over at UCLA Hundreds of protesters over the war in Gaza were arrested this weekend at college campuses across the country. At UCLA, tensions spilled over as demonstrators swarmed past security barricades. NBC News\u2019 Adrienne Broaddus reports on hundreds arrested this weekend. April 28, 2024. Chants from students at the protest included \u201coff our campus,\u201d \u201cfrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\u201d and \u201cIsrael, Israel, what do you say? How many Gazans did you kill today?\u201d Protests at George Washington University this week have served as a convergence point for various universities in the Washington D. C. , Maryland, and Virginia area, with students from Georgetown University, American University, University of Maryland, and George Mason University in attendance. As of Saturday morning, no arrests had been made at the GW protest. George Washington University police officer scan the area as students demonstrate on campus during a pro-Palestinian protest over the Israel-Hamas war on Friday, April 26, 2024, in Washington. To date, more than 34,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military offensive against Hamas. The conflict has not only caused a humanitarian catastrophe but also spilled over to other parts of the region, dragging more parties into the fray. At present, apart from losing the moral high ground because of its callous support of Israel's relentless military offensive in Gaza the US itself is feeling a strong backlash from what it has sowed in the Middle East: Many university campuses in the US are convulsed in chaos as students stage pro-Palestine protests. Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested amid allegations of police brutality, all triggered by the US' lopsided policy on the ongoing conflict. While Emory University hasn\u2019t seen any arrests so far this weekend amid the ongoing war protests (after arrests that were made Thursday at the metro Atlanta campus), the demonstrations at some college campuses weren\u2019t peaceful. More than 200 protesters were arrested Saturday at Northeastern University, Arizona State University, Indiana University and Washington University in St. Louis, according to officials, as colleges across the country struggle to quell growing pro-Palestinian demonstrations and encampments on campus. The New York Times reported that more than 700 protesters have been arrested on U. S. campuses since April 18, when Columbia University had the New York Police Department clear a protest encampment there. In several cases, most of those who were arrested have been released.

He controlled the restart. I got a really good restart on the bottom, and that was a big moment to clear him before that caution came out. Similar to what happened with Chase (Elliott) at Texas, where I was controlling it \u2013 until I wasn\u2019t, but the tides turned today, and I was able to control the restart. Our Mavis Tire Toyota was just so good on the short run. I knew he was going to make a charge, but I just tried to hit my marks. As long as I hit my marks, I felt confident I could hold him off. \u201d Austin Cindric \u2014 Finished 15th: \u201cI\u2019m proud to have a result that is representative. I feel like we\u2019ve struggled to finish these deals out the last month or so, the speed that we\u2019ve shown, so I\u2019m proud of that. Fifteenth is solid, but we still have more progress to make. The guys called a great race. We made good adjustments and it feels nice to execute one. We just need to keep moving forward. \u201d Chase Briscoe \u2014 Finished 19th: \u201cIt was weird. We started off pretty good and we just had one real bad run where we went from fifth to 25th and we just couldn\u2019t find the balance. It was never where we needed it to be. It would be one way and then the next run it would be the other way. Then I got the nose damage. Feel like we let one get away today. Had a really strong Bass Pro Camry. You can't lose control of these races mid-stage like that. The track changes, you get behind. Man, just stinks. Overall, a good day. Just keep working on it. \u201d Kyle Busch \u2014 Finished 4th: \"I felt like today was a good day overall. There are still things to clean up, but I'm proud of a top-five effort. It felt like if we would have restarted third, I might have been able to keep pace maybe somewhere closer to the front. But starting where I did and having to race the 10 was difficult. I hate it for our guys that we didn't get a better finish, but the FICO Camaro was good. \u201d Alex Bowman \u2014 Finished 8th: \u201cBoth front fenders are broke, too, from the deal on pit road, so I\u2019m sure that didn\u2019t help anything. We were really fast in the middle segment of the race. We were probably just a little too tight on the top. I couldn\u2019t rotate the bottom like I wanted to, but I was too free on entry to really free the car up. I could make a lot of pace up top, but it just hurt the tires pretty bad. All-in-all, it was an OK day for our No. 48 Ally Chevy team. Eighth-place here is pretty bad for me, but it was still a good points day and a step in the right direction. It\u2019s a little more consistency than we\u2019ve seen, so hopefully we can keep plugging away at it. \u201d NASCAR Cup Series W\u00fcrth 400 Dover NASCAR Cup results: Denny Hamlin scores third win of the season Joe Gibbs Racing and Hendrick Motorsports have combined to win nine of the first 11 Cup races this season. Ryan Blaney \u2014 Finished 7th: \u201cI still thought we had like fourth to seventh-place potential all day, so I\u2019m proud of the effort by everybody on this team for sticking with it. I really wanted to win one for Wurth. It\u2019s a big race for those guys and they\u2019re a great partner for us, but we just missed out. Hopefully, we can get a redemption shot next year if they do this again, but I appreciate the effort. It was a long day. \u201d Chase Elliott \u2014 Finished 5th: \u201cI was really happy with our car, honestly. A couple of moves here or there. I needed to just get myself a little further forward. But I\u2019m really happy with the NAPA Chevy. We had a really solid day and it was fun. It\u2019s always fun when you can pass your way to the front. \u201d Noah Gragson \u2014 Finished 6th: \u201cI thought we qualified really well and then we kind of fell back there the first half of the race. We got really lucky with that caution coming on the final green flag pit cycle, but the Miller Tech Mustang was good once we got some track position. It just took a little bit, but things fell our way and we were able to come home with a top-10 finish, finishing sixth. Really from the beginning to middle of the race, I felt like we had a ton of speed. We kind of got messed up on the cycle there when the leaders pitted. I pitted a lap later and then the caution came out right away, which pinned us an extra lap down. We were beating the guys that finished 15th through 20th, so I think that\u2019s kind of where we were supposed to end up \u2013 but that is part of racing. I\u2019m super thankful to Legacy Motor Club for putting me in the Dollar Tree Petty 75 Camry this weekend and believing in me. I feel like we should have been six or seven spot better, but it just didn\u2019t work out that way. \u201d Austin Dillon \u2014 Finished 27th: \u201cUnfortunately it was a rough day for us on the No. Denny Hamlin predicted his win at the Dover (Del. ) Motor Speedway ahead of Sunday's W\u00fcrth 400. \"We're going to win Dover,\" he said on his \"Actions Detrimental\" podcast. His bold prediction paid off, as the 43-year-old secured his third win of the season. He led the final 72 laps of the race, holding off points leader Kyle Larson to win the W\u00fcrth 400 by 0. 256 seconds. \"You\u2019d better win if you\u2019re going to open your mouth, that\u2019s for sure,\" Hamlin said after the race.

Heim had a respectable and trouble-free day -- save for one glitch where he got turned into his pit box by Tyler Reddick -- finishing 25th. That came despite the curveball of a crew chief change overnight, as Dave Elenz had to return home to North Carolina to attend to a family matter. Joey Cohen, the team vice president of race operations, served as interim crew chief in Elenz's place. \"In the beginning to middle of the race, I thought we had a ton of speed. We got kind of messed up on the cycle there when the leaders pitted. I pit a lap later and the caution came out right away, which pinned us an extra lap down,\" Heim said after the race.

All-Star point guard Damian Lillard has been diagnosed with a Grade 1 Achilles tendon strain and will miss Game 4 on Sunday, the team announced. Giannis Antetokounmpo has not played since April 9 due to a lingering calf strain. Late in the fourth quarter of their heartbreaking overtime loss in Game 3, the Bucks were trying to foul to extend the game when Lillard re-aggravated his Achilles. Though it went largely unnoticed in real time, you can see Lillard limping as he goes to pick up Patrick Beverley on the replay. While Lillard remained in the game the rest of the way, he did not take a shot in the extra frame. \"Honestly, Dame was really struggling,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after Game 3. That was evident as he poured in a record-setting 35 points in the first half of Game 1. In the other five halves in this series, though, he has a combined 62 points on 16-of-46 (34. 7%) from the field. As a result, the Bucks have dropped Games 2 and 3 and now find themselves down 2-1 in the series. A hampered Lillard is the last thing the Bucks need in the circumstances. Khris Middleton sprained his ankle in Game 2 but came back and was able to summon the strength for a throwback performance on Friday. It would be asking a lot for him to do that again in Game 4 on a bum ankle. Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, remains out indefinitely. I just can't go as far as explosion. ' So I thought Dame just being out there was huge for us. \" Lillard said during his post-game press conference that his \"plan\" was to play in Game 4. \"I think tonight, it was just so fresh, just re-aggravated after having a whole week where you could kind of get it together,\" Lillard said. \"But I just wanted to be on the floor in case some opportunity came up, or however I could help. But obviously, tonight, we're gonna get back and just have to get ahead of it because that's not something you want to play with. \"It's one of those spots on your body where you literally can't do nothing about it. If you can't move, you can't move. Lawrence Frank, the President of the Los Angeles Clippers, announced that superstar Kawhi Leonard would be out for Game 4 with knee inflammation and that there is no timeline for his return. Leonard missed Game 1 of the series after missing the last few weeks of the regular season and struggled in Games 2 and 3.

'When's he coming back?' Can't tell you a timeline, wish I had a crystal ball. \"We don't know yet,\" Rivers told reporters regarding Lillard's Game 4 status. \"Not looking great. \" He also confirmed that the star point guard underwent an MRI on the injury. \"Yeah, he did,\" he said. \"They're going to give us the results soon, so we should know a little bit later today. \" With both Antetokounmpo and Lillard in the lineup this season, the Bucks went 44-21 and outscored opponents by 10. 2 points per 100 possessions while the pair shared the court, according to NBA. com. The Pacers were already a tough matchup for the Bucks, winning the regular-season series, 4-1. And Indiana managed to survive Khris Middleton's heroics in Game 3 to snatch the advantage in the postseason matchup. It's hard to imagine the Bucks winning on the road without Dame and the Greek Freak. Rivers said after the game that Lillard said he lacked his typical explosiveness late in the game. Lillard had a protective walking boot covering his right foot while walking through the team hotel Saturday. Rivers told reporters the team was awaiting MRI results before making a decision about Lillard\u2019s status but that it was \u201cnot looking good. \u201d Milwaukee is trying to even up the series and avoid a second straight first-round exit in the postseason. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews. com/hub/NBA. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Milwaukee Bucks will be without injured All-Stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard when their playoff series resumes Sunday night at Indiana. Both were officially listed as out for a pivotal Game 4 on Sunday\u2019s injury report. Antetokounmpo has missed the first three games in this best-of-seven first round series and has not played since straining his left calf April 9. Rivers said Saturday that he \u201cdoubted\u201d the two-time league MVP would be cleared to play. The Pacers lead the series 2-1. Lillard joined the injury list following Friday night\u2019s 121-118 overtime loss in Game 3. He twisted his left knee in the first quarter, went to the locker room and then injured his Achilles tendon in the waning minutes of regulation. After the game, Damian Lillard clarified that his Achilles aggravation occurred on this play at the end of regulation and not on the foul by Pascal Siakam in the first quarter.

It\u2019s another unlucky blow to hit these Bucks at the wrong time in the playoffs, but bad luck doesn\u2019t change the hard questions Milwaukee needs to ask itself about its roster construction and plans for next season. . Over his career, the Bucks are 4-4 in playoff games he misses. 4-6 in the 2023-24 regular season. Is Damian Lillard playing tonight? No. The Bucks point guard sustained knee and Achilles injuries in Game 3, but it's tendinitis \u2014 inflammation \u2014 in his right Achilles that's keeping him out of Game 4.

Their absence puts a lot of pressure on Khris Middleton \u2014 who scored 42 points last game \u2014 and role players such as Bobby Portis or Patrick Beverley to step up with the game of their careers and keep Milwaukee out of a 1-3 hole it may not be able to climb out of against a younger, faster, and more athletic Pacers roster.

You have to go back another decade before that to find a negative quarter for Starbucks in the U. S. Starbucks has faced challenges heading into 2024, as sales weakened late last year as occasional customers largely abandoned the chain. At least part of that problem was blamed on \u201cmisperceptions\u201d on the company\u2019s stance on the Gaza conflict. And glitches with the system meant some customers struggled to log in. Co-founder Julian Metcalfe, who sold his stake in 2018, said his heart goes out to \u2018customers who feel let down\u2019. Pret said the issues affected a small number of subscribers and have been resolved. The company is also battling a \u00a3700 million debt pile that surged during Covid, higher costs, a decline in office workers \u2014 and the challenge of convincing people squeezed by a surging cost of living to pay close to \u00a34 for a coffee.

S. , same-store sales decreased 3% as traffic sank 7%. This marks the second quarter that the company's home market has struggled. Last quarter, executives blamed sluggish sales on boycotts targeting the company due to \"misperceptions\" of its stance on Israel. Starbucks' international segment reported same-store sales declines of 6% as both average ticket and transactions dropped. In China, Starbucks' second-largest market, same-store sales plunged 11%, fueled by an 8% decline in average ticket. Starbucks and the union have paused the court case and are now in mediation.

Starbucks said its same-store sales \u2014 or sales at stores open at least a year \u2014 dropped 4% in its fiscal second quarter. Wall Street had expected a 1% increase, according to analysts polled by FactSet. In the U. S. , customers spent more per visit, but that wasn\u2019t enough to overcome a 7% decline in transactions.

To make matters worse, renovation work began at the heritage site and the scaffolding put off customers. In January 2024, Henderson took the heartbreaking decision to close: \u201cI tried to be very dispassionate and unemotional about it, which I didn\u2019t succeed in, because I cried in the bath. \u201d She felt \u201clike a failure.

Operating margin of 13. 3% contracted from 17. 0% in the prior year, primarily driven by promotional activities, incremental investments in store partner wages and benefits, as well as sales mix shift, partially offset by pricing in certain markets. 90-day active membership in Starbucks Rewards in the U.

On April 1, the Supreme Court had made clear that \"no physical excavation should be taken which will change the character of the premises in question,\" while refusing to stay the \"scientific survey\" of Bhojshala. On Monday, the High Court rejected the objection of Maulana Kamaluddin Welfare Society and said the respondent was free to approach the appropriate forum if any such violation was taking place. Hindus consider Bhojshala, an ASI-protected 11th-century monument, to be a temple dedicated to Vagdevi (Goddess Saraswati), while the Muslim community calls it Kamal Maula Mosque. As per an arrangement made by the ASI on April 7, 2003, Hindus perform puja in the Bhojshala premises on Tuesdays, while Muslims offer namaz in the complex on Fridays. On March 11, the HC ordered the ASI to conduct a \"scientific survey\" of the Bhojshala-Kamal Moula mosque complex within six weeks..\n\nQuestion: What event did the High Court order the ASI to conduct at Bhojshala-this Religious site mosque complex within six weeks?\nAnswers:\nA.

Trump praised DeSantis on Monday after meeting with the governor in Florida a day earlier. Joe Raedle/Getty Before DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race, Trump spent months mocking and belittling the governor online and on the campaign trail, often referring to him as \"Meatball Ron\" and \"Ron DeSanctimonious. \" Trump accused DeSantis of disloyalty since he had previously endorsed him for governor. Just before losing to Trump in the Iowa caucuses in January, DeSantis blasted the former president during an interview with NBC News Correspondent Dasha Burns. According to Noem, the puppy was \u201cuntrainable\u201d. \u201cWell yeah! She was 14 months old!\u201d Colbert exclaimed. Noem wrote \u2013 \u201cagain, in a story no one asked her to tell us\u201d, Colbert noted \u2013 that she took Cricket on a pheasant hunt that the puppy ruined, going \u201cout of her mind with excitement, chasing all those birds and having the time of her life\u201d. \u201cBut who among us hasn\u2019t seen a dog running through the fields, not a care in the world, and thought \u2018you deserve to die,\u2019\u201d Colbert deadpanned. Cricket then \u201cmade the fatal mistake of continuing to be a normal puppy on the way home\u201d, Colbert noted. Noem wrote that on the way home, Cricket attacked her neighbor\u2019s chickens. \u201cGovernor Noem, if you don\u2019t like untrainable animals that wolf down chicken, I have bad news about your party\u2019s nominee,\u201d Colbert quipped. \u201cShe wants to be his VP, and thought both of those things were positives.

We\u2019re actually trying to win. \u201d After that, DeSantis felt the need to tell donors he would raise money for Trump. But apparently, the governor felt the need to go a step further vis-\u00e0-vis groveling, hence this ring-kissing session with the ex-president that reportedly took place over the weekend. Per The Washington Post: Former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis met privately Sunday morning in Miami, according to people familiar with the matter, breaking a years-long chill between the presumptive Republican nominee and his onetime chief primary rival\u2026. \u201d \u201cThis book is starting to sound less like a political memoir and more like the scrawled manifesto of a guy whose neighbors said, \u2018He just kinda kept to himself, you know?\u2019\u201d Colbert said. Noem said she led Cricket to a gravel pit and shot her, as well as a goat, for smelling bad. \u201cOh my God, what kind of reverse John Wick farm is she running out there?\u201d Colbert exclaimed. Seth Meyers \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to kill a dog named Cricket, it\u2019s another to brag about it in a book,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night. \u201cShe thought telling that story would make her look cool,\u201d Meyers mused. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Does she think cats can vote? And even if they could, those lazy sons of bitches aren\u2019t going to wait in line at a high school for three hours. \u201cThat\u2019s a level of psycho I didn\u2019t even know existed. Even Buffalo Bill [from The Silence of the Lambs] had the self-awareness to keep his abhorrent behavior indoors. He didn\u2019t walk around town saying, \u2018Hey, check out my new outfit. It\u2019s a skin suit!\u2019\u201d Noem defended her actions on X, formerly Twitter, writing: \u201ctough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm\u201d and that she just had to \u201cput down 3 horses a few weeks ago\u201d. \u201cWay to change the narrative,\u201d Meyers mocked. \u201c\u2018Yeah, I killed a dog.

Trump praised DeSantis on Monday after meeting with the governor in Florida a day earlier. Joe Raedle/Getty Before DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race, Trump spent months mocking and belittling the governor online and on the campaign trail, often referring to him as \"Meatball Ron\" and \"Ron DeSanctimonious. \" Trump accused DeSantis of disloyalty since he had previously endorsed him for governor. Just before losing to Trump in the Iowa caucuses in January, DeSantis blasted the former president during an interview with NBC News Correspondent Dasha Burns. \u201cShe wants to be his VP, and thought both of those things were positives.

Trump: If I call up 95% of those people that you say, if I made one phone call, they\u2019d be endorsing me in two minutes. The question I have to ask you is: Why should voters trust you when so many of the people who watched you the most closely in the first term don't think you should serve a second? Trump: Well, they don't because I didn't like them. Some of those people I fired. Bill Barr, I fired Bill Barr. I didn't want him. Other people. I thought he did a terrible job. As soon as he was going to be impeached, he was going to be impeached by the Democrats, he totally folded. Bolton was a fool. He was a stupid fool. And we look at people like a company would look at people. You know, when you buy a company, you go in and you look at, how do you like the job? Job performance. They have job performance standards. And yeah, we would like to get rid of people that haven't done a good job. And there are plenty of them. How do you plan to do that? Your team is preparing to give you the power through Schedule F, which would allow you to fire civil servants. Trump: We\u2019re looking at a lot of different things. Civil service is both very good and very bad. You have some people that are protected that shouldn\u2019t be protected. And you have some people you almost want to protect because they do such a good job. Trump Again Vows Mass Deportations and Won\u2019t Rule Out Political Violence In an interview with Time magazine, the former president said he planned to use the military to deport migrants and would not dismiss the possibility of political violence after this year\u2019s election. And what I was able to do is through the choice of some very good people who frankly were very courageous, the justices it turned out to be you know, the Republican\u2014 States will decide if they're comfortable or not\u2014 Trump: Yeah the states\u2014 Prosecuting women for getting abortions after the ban. But are you comfortable with it? Trump: The states are going to say. It\u2019s irrelevant whether I\u2019m comfortable or not. It's totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions. And by the way, Texas is going to be different than Ohio. And Ohio is going to be different than Michigan. I see what's happening. President Trump, we're here in Florida. You're a resident of Florida. Trump: Yeah. You don't? Trump: No, I don't believe that. I know them all. It's a one-way street, even if they paid. I want them to pay. But I believe if we were attacked, NATO wouldn't be there. Many of the countries in NATO would not be there. Would you continue to provide military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine? Trump: I\u2019m going to try and help Ukraine but Europe has to get there also and do their job. They're not doing their job. Europe is not paying their fair share. Orban says he came here and met with you, and said that you wouldn\u2019t give a penny. Is he wrong? Trump: No, I said I wouldn't give unless Europe starts equalizing. They have to come. Europe has to pay. Would you hire anyone who believes Joe Biden won the 2020 election? Trump: I have no doubt that what we said was fact. The press, the fake news media, doesn't want to talk about it. You know, I have a lawsuit against the Pulitzer Foundation over the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, because they talked about it for two and a half years and it turned out to be a total scam. And then certain writers got Nobel Prizes\u2014 The RNC is holding litmus tests on employees, asking if they believe the election was stolen or not. Would you do the same? [Editor's Note: While the RNC is reportedly asking job applicants this question, it has denied it is a litmus test for employment. ] Trump: I wouldn\u2019t feel good about it, because I think anybody that doesn't see that that election was stolen. So they handed me a letter. I don't think I\u2019ll do that again. I think, from now on, I\u2019ll fire. You know why? Because they say that they quit. They didn't quit. I said, \u201cHand me a letter. \u201d That's a gentleman's thing to do. \u201cGeneral, hand me a letter. \u201d I took care of ISIS. I had people saying it would take five years. I did it in a very short period of time. We have a great military, if you look at our military, I have great support from our military, from the real people, from the real generals, not the television generals. But I could ask for endorsements from 90 to 95% of the people that you're telling me. Every one of them would give me an endorsement.

Do you see why\u2014okay, you say you were joking, but do you see why\u2014 Trump: No, no, wait. If you read it, it was a joke. I wanted to be for one day. You know why? Because we have an incompetent fool that\u2019s allowing people to come into our country. We have an incompetent fool that drove energy prices so high over such a short period of time.

SimpleImages/Getty Images (NEW YORK) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump is on trial in New York City, where he is facing felony charges related to a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. It marks the first time in history that a former U. S. president has been tried on criminal charges. Trump last April pleaded not guilty to a 34-count indictment charging him with falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. Here\u2019s how the news is developing: Apr 30, 2:19 PM Trump begins to remove posts after being held in contempt Former President Trump has begun to remove the social media posts cited by Judge Juan Merchan in today\u2019s gag order ruling. Merchan wrote that he is \u201ckeenly aware of, and protective of,\u201d Trump\u2019s First Amendment rights, \u201cparticularly given his candidacy for the office of President of the United States. \u201d \u201cIt is critically important that defendant\u2019s legitimate free speech rights not be curtailed, that he be able to fully campaign for the office which he seeks and that he be able to respond and defend himself against political attacks,\u201d Merchan wrote. Still, he warned that the court would not tolerate \"willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment. \u201d With that statement, the judge drew nearer the specter of Trump becoming the first former president of the United States behind bars. Jimmy Kimmel has hit out at Ron DeSantis following reports that the Florida governor and Donald Trump had a meeting to discuss the 2024 general election. The comedian dubbed DeSantis a \"pathetic little worm\" during Monday night's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, after The Washington Post claimed the politicians had \"met privately\" in Miami on Sunday. DeSantis was once an ardent Trump supporter, but their friendship cooled off after the 45-year-old decided to run against Trump as a Republican candidate in the presidential primaries.

While Cohen never explicitly said he was negotiating the deal on Trump\u2019s behalf, Davidson felt the implication was clear. \u201cEvery single time I talked to Michael Cohen, he leaned on his close affiliation with Donald Trump,\u201d Davidson said. Plus, he figured that Trump \u201cwas the beneficiary of this contract. \u201d The GOP presidential hopeful is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with the hush money payments. The detailed evidence on business transactions and bank accounts is setting the stage for testimony from Cohen, who went to federal prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and other crimes. The trial \u2014 the first of Trump's four criminal cases to come before a jury \u2014 is expected to last for another month or more. Davidson, who was granted immunity to testify, said that that he has set up nondisclosure agreements for some of his clients, including some with tabloids. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Davidson about his relationship with former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard. Earlier, former Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that Davidson was one of Howard\u2019s sources. \u201cI knew him in my professional dealings,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe were professional acquaintances and friends. \u201d Davidson said he first met Michael Cohen in 2011 after a blog was posted about Stormy Daniels \u2014 who was Davidson\u2019s client \u2014 and Donald Trump. \u201cMichael Cohen is the former attorney for Donald Trump,\u201d Davidson recounted. 19, 2022, deposition taken at Mar-a-Lago, in which Trump confirms he married his wife Melania in 2005. Thompson then read from the transcript of a deposition where Trump is asked about the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video in which he boasts about grabbing women. Thompson then stepped off the witness stand. Apr 30, 12:02 PM \u2018We don\u2019t win\u2019 if people think stories are true, Trump said in 2016 As part of a series of video, jurors were shown a video of an October 2016 Trump rally in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania \u201cThey are trying to poison the mind of the American voter. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d Trump said in the video. Lastly, jurors sew a brief video of a press conference by President-elect Trump praising Michael Cohen. The 56-year-old also poked fun at reports that De Santis will raise money for Trump's campaign, telling the audience: \"I would love to have been in that room [with] Trump going: 'No I called you meatball in a good way. '\" \"Poor Ron De Santis, what a pathetic little worm,\" he continued. \"They said he did because he wants to run for president again in 2028. That seems like a great idea, what he doesn't realize is, Trump is also going to be running for president again in 2028. \" Newsweek has reached out to DeSantis for comment via email. This isn't the first time that Kimmel has taken aim at De Santis. Kimmel described him as \"the terrible governor of Florida\" in 2021 after De Santis said he'd take executive action to ban Joe Biden's vaccine passport proposal. \u201cThe people will seek to cross-examine him on those findings,\u201d Colangelo said. Colangelo also argued that prosecutors should be able to introduce evidence about what he called Trump\u2019s \u201cpressure campaign\u201d and \u201cintimidation effort\u201d for witnesses like Michael Cohen. Colangelo argued that defense attorneys \u201copened the door\u201d to the evidence during their opening statement by arguing that some of the witnesses like Cohen and Stormy Daniels benefited personally from their involvement in the case. He mentioned that prosecutors have approximately half-a-dozen exhibits to demonstrate Trump\u2019s effort attacking witnesses. Colangelo said the evidence would help show Trump\u2019s \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d and explain why some witnesses made contradictory statements about the case. Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation cases against Trump. Jurors were shown several videos, starting with Trump\u2019s October 2022 deposition in that case.

Trump and DeSantis met privately on Sunday in the Sunshine State, the Washington Examiner previously reported.

It happened again when some of the Republicans who denounced the Jan. 6 attack began to soften their criticism of Trump and the rioters who stormed the Capitol and turned to attacking Democrats for harping on the issue. Politics isn\u2019t a game of consistency. If anything, it\u2019s calculation and opportunism that wins in the end, no matter party affiliation \u2014 and Trump commands voters other Republicans also need to win elections. DeSantis was clearly aware of that even as he challenged Trump in the primary. He pulled punches until he had no choice, and even when he attacked Trump it wasn\u2019t for his lack of democratic values but, oddly, for not being Trumpian enough. DeSantis will have to swallow his pride if he doesn\u2019t want to have an enemy in Trump. She has said that she would be \"honoured\" to serve in the Trump administration \"in any capacity\". Marco Rubio [Getty Images] Mr Trump and Marco Rubio did not get on in the 2016 Republican primary race. Mr Trump called him \"Little Marco\" - a reference to his stature - while Mr Rubio commented about Mr Trump's small hands. The Florida senator has since worked closely with his former rival, endorsing him early on in this primary season. The son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio was once floated as a potential running mate to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. At only 52 he is comparatively young and telegenic, and he could help Mr Trump gain a larger share of the Latino vote.

He told Mr Trump: he said to Mr Trump: \"I just love you. \" With a smile, the former president responded: \"That's why you're a great politician. \" Since then, Mr Trump has often remarked that Mr Scott is \"much better [at advocating] for me than he was for himself\".

Lyman, a certified public accountant, has derided the governor\u2019s \u201cDisagree Better\u201d initiative, accused Cox of being too quick to compromise on conservative positions and claimed he has contributed to making Utah a quasi-sanctuary state for migrants who entered the country illegally. \u201cAs a former county commissioner, I understand the pressure that exists to support incumbent governors,\u201d Lyman told the Deseret News. \u201cAs a candidate for governor my top focus is earning the support of Utah voters \u2014 including the informed and committed delegates of the Republican Party, who strongly voted for a change in direction on Saturday. \u201d He continued: \u201cI consider all of these commissioners to be my close friends, and I expect to have their full support after securing a victory in the Republican primary. Ms Sanders has not however endeared herself to her former boss, with a belated endorsement of his re-election and a declaration that being governor is is \"one of the best jobs I could ever ask for. and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years\". It happened again when some of the Republicans who denounced the Jan. 6 attack began to soften their criticism of Trump and the rioters who stormed the Capitol and turned to attacking Democrats for harping on the issue. Politics isn\u2019t a game of consistency. If anything, it\u2019s calculation and opportunism that wins in the end, no matter party affiliation \u2014 and Trump commands voters other Republicans also need to win elections. DeSantis was clearly aware of that even as he challenged Trump in the primary. He pulled punches until he had no choice, and even when he attacked Trump it wasn\u2019t for his lack of democratic values but, oddly, for not being Trumpian enough. DeSantis will have to swallow his pride if he doesn\u2019t want to have an enemy in Trump. She has said that she would be \"honoured\" to serve in the Trump administration \"in any capacity\". Marco Rubio [Getty Images] Mr Trump and Marco Rubio did not get on in the 2016 Republican primary race. Mr Trump called him \"Little Marco\" - a reference to his stature - while Mr Rubio commented about Mr Trump's small hands. The Florida senator has since worked closely with his former rival, endorsing him early on in this primary season. The son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio was once floated as a potential running mate to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. At only 52 he is comparatively young and telegenic, and he could help Mr Trump gain a larger share of the Latino vote. That race, won by Democrat Tom Suozzi, was viewed as a test of the parties' general election strategies on immigration and abortion. Dickson, a retired FBI special agent, acknowledged the challenges of running in the upstate district when he announced his candidacy at the end of February, saying he was in the race to give voters a choice. He said he supports Trump as the Republican nominee for president but described his own politics as \"more towards the center. \" After conceding the race, Dickson told supporters he had no regrets about running. Voting took place with Trump on trial in New York City in the first criminal trial of a former American president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury. The Yale-educated former venture capitalist wrote the best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that followed his blue-collar upbringing in the \"rust-belt\" Midwest. Once a self-identified \"never-Trumper\", Mr Vance refashioned himself when he ran for the Senate in 2022 with Mr Trump's crucial endorsement. In office, he has championed many of the issues that animate Mr Trump's base. Mr Vance believes he would be of better use to a future Trump administration in the Senate, but he has not ruled out being vice-president. \"I want to help him however I can,\" he recently said. Kristi Noem [Getty Images] Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, once topped a poll taken by mostly Trump diehards on who he should pick as his vice-president..\n\nQuestion: Who did this Politician endorse after dropping his bid for the Republican candidacy?\nAnswers:\nA.

TEMPE, AZ (AZFamily) \u2014 A new controversy is stemming from the arrests of dozens of Pro-Palestinian protesters at ASU over the weekend. According to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) Arizona, four ASU students had their hijabs forcibly removed by ASU police. A video showing part of the said incident was shared with Arizona\u2019s Family by CAIR-AZ. David Chami, an attorney and volunteer board member for CAIR-AZ, said there was no legitimate reason for officers to search her. He added that since the student had been restrained, a female officer could have conducted the search in private instead of out in the open by four male officers. \u201cIt was very clear from the beginning that law enforcement was determined to crush the protest, to prevent these students and citizens from practicing their First Amendment rights. He said the students have retained counsel. He explained CAIR-AZ and himself will, in some capacity, be involved in legal action. The CAIR-AZ Executive Director, Azza Abuseif, said in a statement: \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees the free practice of religion. Police cannot suspend this right. We condemn the reported actions of ASU police and call for a full investigation into this incident. \u201d The ACLU of Arizona posted on X saying, \u201cThis video showing police forcibly removing a woman\u2019s religious dress is outrageous. Muslims, like all of us in the United States, have the right to practice their religion. Law enforcement must respect the religious freedom rights of everyone protesting in Arizona. \u201d See a spelling or grammatical error in our story? Please click here to report it. We condemn the reported actions of ASU police and call for a full investigation into this incident. \u201d Stating that there are reports that the headscarves of at least four women detained in the demonstrations were removed, Abuseif said CAIR Arizona is looking into the incident.

Three former Ole Miss players hear their names called during the 2024 NFL draft. How many will take the stage in 2025? Better yet, how many prospect will garner first-round buzz? While the Rebels prepare for a promising year in Oxford, mock drafts have gone crazy over the past two days looking ahead to next April. Plenty can \u2014 and will \u2014 over the next 360-plus days, but a player like Princely Umanmielen should remain a steadfast in mock draft circles. In the latest mock draft from CBS Sports, Umanmielen doesn't have to wait long to hear his name called, having been selected with the No. 11 overall pick. The Kansas City Chiefs are making moves to ensure they could be the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowl championships in a row. The first of those moves was to extend head coach Andy Reid to a new five-year, $100 million deal that makes him the highest-paid coach in the league. The Chiefs also extended president Mark Donovan and general manager Brett Veach, keeping the core of the front office together to also keep together its core in the front office. During the 2024 NFL Draft, the team moved up in a trade with the Bills to select the combine's fastest receiver, Xavier Worthy. Worthy's 4. 21 40-yard dash is now an NFL Combine record. Although Mahomes ended up not playing a bigger role on Monday night, he still brought more excitement to the event. He also posed backstage with WWE chief content officer Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque. The Green Bay Packers made 11 selections in the 2024 NFL draft, starting with offensive lineman Jordan Morgan at No. 25 overall in the first round and ending with cornerback Kalen King at No. 255 overall in the seventh round. It\u2019s time to break down the class. Best picks. Sleepers. Winners. Losers. Strategy. Let\u2019s dig in. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Packers\u2019 draft class in 2024:. It would make sense for Umanmielen to be a favorite to land on Day 1 after his promising career at Florida. Last season, he posted a career-high 7. 5 sacks and 11. 5 tackles for loss en route to an underwhelming finish with the Gators. Now, Umanmielen looks to become a more full-fledge pass rusher in Oxford before his next step to Sunday football. \u201cI feel like here I\u2019m getting coached harder for things like (attacking the run game),\u201d Umanmielen said on the latest edition of 'The Ivey League Podcast. ' \u201cI feel like at Florida, the way I was coached, it was almost as if they were just telling me to go out there and use my talent. The Patriots released veteran offensive tackle Conor McDermott on Monday. McDermott, 31, started 11 games over the last two seasons with the Patriots including six in 2023. The 6-foot-8, 305-pound offensive lineman was originally selected by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of UCLA but was waived before Week 1 of his rookie season and claimed by the Bills. After time with the Bills and Jets, he was re-signed by the Patriots late in the 2022 season. The Patriots selected offensive tackle Caedan Wallace in the third round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of Penn State. He joins Mike Onwenu, Chukwuma Okorafor, Calvin Anderson, Vederian Lowe, Andrew Stueber and Tyrone Wheatley Jr. on the Patriots\u2019 90-man roster.

Former President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media at Manhattan criminal court on Friday in New York City. Right-wing media personality Steve Bannon urged Trump on Thursday to \"turn the guns\" on President Joe Biden and not focus on Judge Juan Merchan who is overseeing the former president's criminal hush money trial. More Michael M.

Any liberals tempted to celebrate the anti-abortion climate sceptic Johnson as moderate adjacent \u2013 perhaps even a secret member of the anti-Trump resistance \u2013 received a wake-up call on Wednesday when he staged a performative press conference at Columbia University in New York, telling protesters against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza to \u201cgo back to class\u201d and threatening to cut federal funding for colleges. The speaker followed up with an interview on CNN in which he pushed the widely debunked claim that Hamas placed babies in ovens and cooked them alive during the 7 October attack, and the sweeping generalisation that students were waving flags to celebrate the perpetrators \u2013 thereby dismissing honest concerns for the lives of innocent Palestinian men, women and children. What followed was a rash of complaints filed with the Education Department\u2019s civil rights office \u2014 an arm of the Biden administration that enforces Title VI, a provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in programs receiving federal aid. Since the war began, the office opened 93 investigations into cases of discrimination against members of ethno-religious groups \u2014 about seven times the number begun in a comparable period before Hamas\u2019 attack. The complaints involve both secondary schools and some of the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities, including Columbia, Harvard, Princeton and Yale. \u201cWhile the evidence is often clear and convincing, many Title VI investigations have remained unresolved for months, and even years,\u201d Gottheimer wrote. \u201cThe proliferation of attacks and threats on Jewish and pro-Israel students demands immediate action,\u201d he added. Right-wing media personality Steve Bannon urged Donald Trump on Thursday to \"turn the guns\" on President Joe Biden and not focus on Judge Juan Merchan who is overseeing the former president's criminal hush money trial. Trump and Biden have clinched nominations of the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively amid this year's presidential election, but a rematch of 2020 is unpopular with voters who routinely tell pollsters that they believe neither should get a second term. Meanwhile, hypothetical general election matchups have generally shown the two in a neck-and-neck race.

It\u2019s easy for people to be frustrated about a whole bunch of different things. My choice as leader is, \u2018OK, do I bow down to that even though I think it\u2019s wrong?'\u201d said Trudeau.

Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is not investigating Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Willis is prosecuting the Georgia election interference case against Trump, while Trump owes more than $454 million after losing a civil fraud case brought by James. \"Why does Jordan. not have a criminal conspiracy investigation from Fani Willis in Georgia to 'Big Tish James' in New York City?\" Bannon said, referring to Jordan. \"The Justice Department, why they've not been sent letters, preserve your documents. On Friday night, MSNBC host Chris Hayes explained why Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s thrice-weekly podcast \u201cappears to be a serious ethical and campaign-finance scandal in the making. \u201d First, Hayes pointed out that recording three podcast episodes a week is a big chunk of time away from what is supposed to be Cruz\u2019s full-time job: representing and serving the second-most populous state in the country. That\u2019s in addition to being in the middle of a somewhat tight race for re-election. But the much bigger stink is how it looks like Cruz is covering up \u2013 in cahoots with iHeartRadio - all the dough he\u2019s getting. HAYES: Back in 2022, Cruz partnered with iHeartRadio, the number one syndicator of U. S. radio programming, reaching 245 million people each month. At one end of the spectrum, Vox\u2019s \u201cToday, Explained\u201d is broadcast across U. S. public radio stations. The other is YXE Underground, which focuses on the stories of Saskatoon\u2019s unsung community leaders. The prime minister\u2019s availability to such a smaller market came as a surprise: when Trudeau\u2019s team initially reached out, the show\u2019s host thought it was a scam and deleted the email. As Trudeau tries to reignite the support of millennial and Gen-Z Canadians, he is opening up about more than just policy and his political challenges. The Canadian Press listened to the string of interviews to get a sense of Trudeau\u2019s thinking, as the clock ticks down to the next federal election. Trudeau\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change through consumer carbon pricing is a major theme. Daniels had alleged she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated. In March, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump, barring him from making public statements about witnesses as well as lawyers and staff in the case and their families. The order excluded Merchan and Bragg, but it was later expanded to include Merchan and Bragg's families after the former president made blistering attacks toward the judge's daughter, Loren Merchan.

He added that the election is \"going to be a dogfight. Trump's going to win this but, man, it's going to be a fight, a real fight. \" Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign and Biden's campaign via email for comment. Biden told longtime SiriusXM radio show host Howard Stern during an interview on Friday that he would be \"happy\" to debate Trump. The former president then responded as he left the New York courtroom on Friday and said, \"I've invited Biden to debate. He can do it anytime he wants, including tonight. I'm ready, here we are, I invited him to the courthouse that he has us tied up in. \" \"I'm ready, willing, and able. Former President Donald Trump's longtime ally Steve Bannon branded House Speaker Mike Johnson a \"disgusting, revolting loser. \" Bannon, a onetime White House chief strategist and right-wing media personality, has intensified his attacks on Johnson since he pushed his party to support a $95-billion aid package that sends support to Ukraine, Israel and other U. S. allies. Johnson came under fire from MAGA Republicans for overseeing the passage of the military aid opposed by Trump, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene threatening to move to oust Johnson. However, Trump has reiterated his support for Johnson, saying he is \"a very good person\" and \"trying very hard. \" On his War Room podcast on Saturday, Bannon accused Johnson of not releasing a lengthy report about a \"criminal conspiracy investigation\" that could have helped Trump, who is currently on trial in New York.

Willis is prosecuting the Georgia election interference case against Trump, while Trump owes more than $454 million after losing a civil fraud case brought by James. \"Why does Jordan. not have a criminal conspiracy investigation from Fani Willis in Georgia to 'Big Tish James' in New York City?\" Bannon said, referring to Jordan. \"The Justice Department, why they've not been sent letters, preserve your documents. \u201d And while the prime minister who legalized cannabis said he\u2019s tried weed before, \u201cit\u2019s never been my thing. \u201d He\u2019s more of a \u201cbeer and bourbon kind of guy,\u201d and \u201ceven then, not too much. \u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 28, 2024.

Right-wing media personality Steve Bannon urged Donald Trump on Thursday to \"turn the guns\" on President Joe Biden and not focus on Judge Juan Merchan who is overseeing the former president's criminal hush money trial. Trump and Biden have clinched nominations of the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively amid this year's presidential election, but a rematch of 2020 is unpopular with voters who routinely tell pollsters that they believe neither should get a second term. Meanwhile, hypothetical general election matchups have generally shown the two in a neck-and-neck race.

SUNRISE \u2014 Jon Cooper walked off the ice Monday night at Amerant Bank Arena and into the offseason, dodging plastic rats after the traditional end-of-series handshake line. The Lightning coach looked up into the stands before disappearing down the tunnel, shaking his head in frustration. After dropping the first three games to the Panthers, the Lightning might not have had enough to dig out and win the best-of-seven series against their cross-state rivals. But having two goals negated in the middle of a tightly-contested Game 5 certainly stymied their chance to turn the tide. Their 6-1 loss ended what was a roller-coaster season with their second straight first-round playoff exit \u2014 after three straight rides to the Stanley Cup final (and back-to-back championships). The Lightning eliminated Florida in their two previous playoff meetings, but this time, the Panthers were better. Enter Email Sign Up Niko Mikkola had a goal and an assist, Evan Rodrigues also scored, and Matthew Tkachuk had two assists for the Panthers, who won a playoff series against Tampa Bay for the first time in franchise history and clinched a postseason series at home for only the fourth time. Florida bested Boston and Philadelphia on home ice in the first two rounds of the 1996 playoffs, then eliminated Carolina at home in last season\u2019s Eastern Conference finals en route to their second Stanley Cup Final appearance. The Panthers didn\u2019t downplay it: Monday night\u2019s win meant a lot. All three playoff series between the two teams have come in the last four years, with Tampa Bay winning the first one, 4-2, in 2021 and then sweeping Florida in 2022.

But the fact that his team was, in his opinion, robbed of two goals by goaltender interference calls was a bitter pill to end his season with. The Lightning\u2019s plan in Game 5 was to be physical in the net front. Panthers goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky had been the best player on the ice throughout the series, so getting bodies in front of him to make him uneasy was the blueprint. \u201cIt\u2019s a big game plan for us to be at that net,\u201d said center Anthony Cirelli. \u201cSo in those situations, you want to be as tight as you can without bumping them or without being in the paint.

The Panthers, who are the No. 1 seed from the Atlantic Division, will have home-ice advantage in the best-of-7 series against the Bruins, the No. 2 seed from the Atlantic, or the Maple Leafs, the No. 3 seed. The Bruins lead that series 3-1 with Game 5 in Boston on Tuesday (7 p. m.

Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe each had two goals and an assist to go along with 31 saves from Sergei Bobrovsky, and the Panthers beat the Lightning, 6-1, in Game 5 on Monday night to clinch their first-round series and advance in the NHL playoffs.

Schechter/NHLI via Getty Images The Tampa Bay Lightning's season is over after losing Game 5 against the Florida Panthers 6-1 on Monday. After going down 3-0 in the series, the Lightning managed to get a win in Game 4, but they weren't able to rally to force a Game 6 and have now been eliminated from the playoffs. Tampa Bay had two goals called back in the game, though those goals wouldn't have made much of a difference as the Panthers put four goals on the board in the final period to make it a comfortable win. With the loss, NHL fans now claim that the Panthers have officially ended the Lightning dynasty. Advertisement \u201cThis was a big series for us,\u201d said Tkachuk, who had three goals and six assists in the first round. \u201cWe always knew that for us ultimately to win it all, it was probably going to have to go through Tampa at some point, so just an amazing feeling closing it out at home. \u201d Victor Hedman scored for the Lightning, which was eliminated in the first round for the second straight year after reaching the Final three straight years. Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 33 shots. Verhaeghe opened scoring for the Panthers with a four-on-four goal just 45 seconds into the second period. Verhaeghe grabbed his own rebound and wristed a shot past Vasilevskiy. Barkov gave Florida a 2-0 lead when he pounced on a rebound for a short-handed goal \u2014 his first of the playoffs \u2014 at 7:22 of the second period. SUNRISE, Fla. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can finally exhale, Cats fans. After being knocked out of the playoffs by their cross-state rival in two of the last three seasons, the Florida Panthers finally got over the hump by eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning with a 6-1 win in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference First Round on Monday at Amerant Bank Arena. For players that endured those years of heartbreak, the series win tastes that much sweeter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one team that always kind of beats you in the playoffs, both times in kind of similar situation where we have the home-ice advantage and both times they beat us, you want to beat them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to get over that hump. Big respect to them. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been unbelievable the past few years, making the Finals and winning those Cups. SUNRISE \u2014 Jon Cooper walked off the ice Monday night at Amerant Bank Arena and into the offseason, dodging plastic rats after the traditional end-of-series handshake line. The Lightning coach looked up into the stands before disappearing down the tunnel, shaking his head in frustration. After dropping the first three games to the Panthers, the Lightning might not have had enough to dig out and win the best-of-seven series against their cross-state rivals. But having two goals negated in the middle of a tightly-contested Game 5 certainly stymied their chance to turn the tide. Their 6-1 loss ended what was a roller-coaster season with their second straight first-round playoff exit \u2014 after three straight rides to the Stanley Cup final (and back-to-back championships). The Lightning eliminated Florida in their two previous playoff meetings, but this time, the Panthers were better. \" Trade deadline acquisitions Duclair and Matt Dumba are pending UFAs, as are Tyler Motte, Austin Watson, Calvin de Haan and Haydn Fleury. The core is strong with NHL leading scorer Nikita Kucherov, Brayden Point, Brandon Hagel, Hedman, Sergachev, Cirelli and Vasilevskiy. It would be better if Stamkos returns.

The last two parts of the story happened Sunday at American Airlines Center, where Leonard\u2019s latest bleak diagnosis was followed by what would have been a heartbreaking, historic collapse on the court, had it stood. Had Harden not been there to keep the Clippers afloat. He got to the free-throw line, of course, and went 5 for 5 from the stripe. And then, when the walls had closed in, he willfully pried them back open with his soft touch around the rim, scoring 15 fourth-quarter points \u2013 the most by any Clipper in the final period of a postseason game since Montrezl Harrell had 16 against the Mavericks in Game 5 in 2020, a game they won, 154-111. Harden showed up Sunday, just as he has all series, coming through as the Clippers\u2019 most consistent scoring threat while Leonard tried unsuccessfully tried to fight through his knee inflammation and George struggled to get going offensively and to contend with Dallas\u2019 dynamic guards without fouling. After scoring 33 points on Sunday, Harden is averaging 26 per game entering Game 5 on 54. 1% shooting, including 50% from 3-point range. This time, they\u2019re rocking the Beard.

Who knows when Leonard is going to catch another pass from George, or when he will dunk again. But the Clippers did what they had to do without him on Sunday as they beat the Mavericks 116-111 to tie the best-of-seven-series in Dallas 2-2 while reclaiming home-court advantage. After struggling with fouls in the first three games of the series, Paul George scored 26 of his 33 points in a foul-free first half that saw the Clippers lead by as many as 31 points. His seventh 3-pointer gave the Clippers the lead. Add in Harden utilizing a new high-volume floater game, making six such shots in the fourth quarter alone as part of a 33-point performance. The Clippers are now 2-0 in the series without Leonard playing, taking massive first-half leads and holding on to squeak out wins. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue, chatting with center Mason Plumlee as he waits to check into the game, was a calming influence in the middle of a Game 4 storm in Dallas. Tyronn Lue gathered his team in the huddle during a timeout with 2 minutes and 14 seconds left Sunday in Game 4 and looked them in the eyes with a firmness after the Clippers\u2019 31-point lead had evaporated down to one. Lue was the calm Clippers coach at a time when the Dallas Mavericks had overwhelmed his team and changed the momentum of the game. Lue was resolute in the middle of a Mavericks offensive storm in which Kyrie Irving was virtually unstoppable. Advertisement Lue was steadfast in his belief in the Clippers during the game\u2019s most tense moment even with their best player, Kawhi Leonard, sidelined because of inflammation in his right knee. Paul George and Josh Green (Image Source: Getty Images) On Sunday night, Paul George pulled out every trick out of his bag to combat the fiery Mavs. With the Dallas side leading the series, the Clippers could not afford to go down 3-1 in hostile territory, and PG13 made sure of it. In the 1st quarter, with 36 seconds remaining on the clock, Paul George took on Josh Green near the halfway line before twisting and turning to the 3-point line. When the clock struck 30 seconds, the 33-year-old was off celebrating his 3-point hit to make the score 36-14. While turning away, George looked at the commentary desk and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\u201d to JJ Redick, who was in awe of the moment produced by George.

Be honest, you very likely didn\u2019t like the trade \u2013 Harden and P. J. Tucker for Robert Covington, Nicolas Batum, Marcus Morris, K. J.

Go home, try to take care of business. But just take it one game at a time. \u201d That\u2019s the kind of poise and mindset the Clippers need after another gut-punch of not having their franchise cornerstone. The Clippers took body blows from the Mavericks with Leonard, and fell into a series hole. Leonard\u2019s absence and uncertain status caves LA\u2019s ceiling, yet again. But in the meantime, they can only control what they can and give themselves \u2014 and Leonard \u2014 a chance to come back. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue, chatting with center Mason Plumlee as he waits to check into the game, was a calming influence in the middle of a Game 4 storm in Dallas. Tyronn Lue gathered his team in the huddle during a timeout with 2 minutes and 14 seconds left Sunday in Game 4 and looked them in the eyes with a firmness after the Clippers\u2019 31-point lead had evaporated down to one.

And then, when the walls had closed in, he willfully pried them back open with his soft touch around the rim, scoring 15 fourth-quarter points \u2013 the most by any Clipper in the final period of a postseason game since Montrezl Harrell had 16 against the Mavericks in Game 5 in 2020, a game they won, 154-111. Harden showed up Sunday, just as he has all series, coming through as the Clippers\u2019 most consistent scoring threat while Leonard tried unsuccessfully tried to fight through his knee inflammation and George struggled to get going offensively and to contend with Dallas\u2019 dynamic guards without fouling. After scoring 33 points on Sunday, Harden is averaging 26 per game entering Game 5 on 54. 1% shooting, including 50% from 3-point range. Who knows when Leonard is going to catch another pass from George, or when he will dunk again. But the Clippers did what they had to do without him on Sunday as they beat the Mavericks 116-111 to tie the best-of-seven-series in Dallas 2-2 while reclaiming home-court advantage. After struggling with fouls in the first three games of the series, Paul George scored 26 of his 33 points in a foul-free first half that saw the Clippers lead by as many as 31 points. His seventh 3-pointer gave the Clippers the lead. Add in Harden utilizing a new high-volume floater game, making six such shots in the fourth quarter alone as part of a 33-point performance.

He had a lot of big games in his career. He\u2019s scored a lot of points in his career, and we know he can do it,\u201d Zubac said. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s that time, we trust him, and we wouldn\u2019t want anyone else. Paul George and Josh Green (Image Source: Getty Images) On Sunday night, Paul George pulled out every trick out of his bag to combat the fiery Mavs. With the Dallas side leading the series, the Clippers could not afford to go down 3-1 in hostile territory, and PG13 made sure of it. In the 1st quarter, with 36 seconds remaining on the clock, Paul George took on Josh Green near the halfway line before twisting and turning to the 3-point line. When the clock struck 30 seconds, the 33-year-old was off celebrating his 3-point hit to make the score 36-14. While turning away, George looked at the commentary desk and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\u201d to JJ Redick, who was in awe of the moment produced by George.

Ivica Zubac became something of a fan on Sunday afternoon, taking a backseat and enjoying the performance of his future Hall of Fame teammates. \u201cIt was incredible, man,\u201d Zubac told reporters in Dallas after Paul George and James Harden helped the Clippers tie the first-round playoff series against the Dallas Mavericks at 2-2 with a 116-111 victory. \u201cWhen PG shot that corner three \u2026 that shot, it just dropped in. That\u2019s what PG does, always making big shots for us. James, too. Getting into the paint, blowing by his defenders, getting into those floaters, it was incredible. \u201cThat\u2019s what we expect them to do. We expect them to finish the games. We expect them to make the right plays at the end of the game and that\u2019s why they\u2019re who they are and that\u2019s why they get paid the big money.

Some important things to know about David Leitch\u2019s The Fall Guy is that it stars Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt with a loving ode towards stunt performers. One thing you may not know is that filming was done in Sydney, Australia. When recollecting their times filming in The Land Down Under, The Fall Guy\u2019s two leads, of course, had to throw some jabs towards Australian native Chris Hemsworth in the process. Chris Hemsworth and his family have been living in Sydney, Australia ever since 2021. The Hemsworths\u2019 reasons for moving away from Hollywood was to keep themselves away from constantly being in the public eye. You would think Emily Blunt would turn towards the Australian native for things to do in Sydney, but she told The Project that the Thor actor is not her \u201cgo-to Aussie. \u201d \"Blunt: I mean, she\u2019s not Australian. One of the worst movie sins is when a comedy fails to at least match the natural charisma of its stars.

But Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt seem, at least from afar, adept at that game. Just look at their charming press tour for \u201cThe Fall Guy. \u201d Theirs is the kind of fun banter that can be a little worrisome \u2014 what if their riffing is better than the movie?

Here is a delightful blend of action, comedy and romance that will make the audience feel like a Hollywood insider for a few hours (although there are perhaps one too many jokes about Comic-Con and Hall H). Speaking of The Fall Guy, Blunt discussed starring as the movie-within-a-movie\u2019s director opposite Ryan Gosling as its stunt double. Directed by David Leitch, the action-comedy also features Hannah Waddingham, Winston Duke, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Stephanie Hsu.

All the rumors suggest we're in for the biggest revamp of the lineup yet and the book-style foldable will be the star. So here's what we know so far. It will launch in July Samsung will launch the Galaxy Z Fold6 alongside the Galaxy Z Flip6, the new Galaxy Watch7 series, and the novel Galaxy Ring in July. Reports point to July 10, which is right before the summer Olympics kick off on July 26. This continues the trend with Samsung's past Galaxy foldable releases - the Galaxy Z Fold4 arrived in late August, while the Z Fold5 came in early August. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors A few days ago, a new leak suggested that July 10 is the date when the Z Fold 6 will break cover, alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5. We might also get the unveilings of the Galaxy Watch 7, the Galaxy Buds 3, and the Galaxy Ring at the same time. Quick Summary A new report suggests Samsung will indeed release a higher-end foldable phone this year, as has been rumoured previously. In addition, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra will be announced during the July Unpacked event alongside the other handsets in the range. It was expected to come later than that. Samsung's release calendar for this year's foldable phones just got a little more interesting, with confirmation from another report that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra is on the way and sooner than we thought. Android Headlines reports that its sources have confirmed the phone's existence and that it'll arrive this summer along with the other new devices during Unpacked. That means we're probably getting the biggest shake-up Samsung's folding phone offering has been given in a while. The foldable phone market is heating up, and Samsung, the leader in the category, is rumoured to be launching not one, but possibly three new foldable phones this summer. While the standard Galaxy Z Fold 6 has been the focus of most leaks, a recent discovery hints at a potential \u201cUltra\u201d version, raising questions about what this premium model might offer. A leak revealed a new Samsung phone with the model number SM-F958N. The \u201c8\u201d at the end often signifies an Ultra variant, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. This has sparked speculation that Samsung might be introducing a Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra alongside the standard model. However, there\u2019s a twist. Unlike previous foldable models with model numbers ending in 6, there are currently no signs of regional variants for the Z Fold 6 Ultra. This includes the Xiaomi 12 series, encompassing the standard, Pro, and Lite variants, along with their upcoming successors, the Xiaomi 13 and 14 lines, likely including Pro and Ultra variants as well. The foldable Xiaomi Mix Fold series, with its second and third iterations, is also likely to receive the update. While official confirmation is still awaited, select mid-range models from Xiaomi\u2019s 12T series might potentially join the list. Xiaomi 12 Xiaomi 12 Pro Xiaomi 12 Lite Xiaomi 12S Ultra Xiaomi 13 Xiaomi 13 Pro Xiaomi 13 Ultra Xiaomi 14 Xiaomi 14 Pro Xiaomi 14 Ultra Xiaomi Mix Fold 2 Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 Xiaomi 12T Xiaomi 12T Pro Xiaomi 13T Xiaomi 13T Pro Other Major Brands: Exploring Expected Compatibility Several other major smartphone brands are also expected to offer Android 15 to their users.

Still, one thing that Android Headlines does confidently assert is that the Z Fold 6 Ultra will have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset at its heart, which would mean that it performs extremely powerfully under stress tests. Samsung\u2019s \u201cUltra\u201d branding signifies a premium tier with top-of-the-line specs and features. A Z Fold 6 Ultra would likely cater to users willing to pay extra for the best possible foldable experience. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra: Latest Leaks and Specs The exact differences between the standard and Ultra models remain unclear. Rumours suggest both will run on the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. Areas where the Ultra might differentiate itself could include: Larger display or a higher resolution: The Ultra could boast a slightly bigger main display when unfolded, or offer a sharper resolution for even more immersive visuals. The Ultra could boast a slightly bigger main display when unfolded, or offer a sharper resolution for even more immersive visuals. 06\" ultrawide shooters. A 10 MP 1/3\" punch hole selfie, and a 16MP 1/3\" under-display selfie camera complete the list. Best part is this base model Galaxy Z Fold6 could be cheaper than we expected. This report says it could launch at $799. That's amazing value, considering the Galaxy Z Fold5 started out at nearly twice that. Of course, $799 could translate to nearly \u20ac1,000 across the pond. New design with a thinner frame and a wider cover display Samsung marginally tweaks the design of the Galaxy Z Fold each year, but it's too conservative and fallen behind the competition lately. Last year, we got a flat-closing phone with an ever-so-slight widening of the aspect ratio. This year, we're hearing of more substantial changes. We already mentioned the thinner frame, expected to allow for an 11mm folded Galaxy Z Fold6. Nothing Phone (2a) comes with IP54 rating which makes it resistant to splash. Nothing Phone (2a) is backed by a 5000 mAh battery with 45W fast charging support. A more advanced camera setup with additional lenses or improved sensor technology could be a selling point for the Ultra. Premium materials: Samsung might use higher-grade materials like a more durable hinge or a luxurious back panel on the Ultra model. Samsung might use higher-grade materials like a more durable hinge or a luxurious back panel on the Ultra model. Increased storage: The Ultra could offer a larger base storage capacity compared to the standard Z Fold 6. The rumour mill also churns out whispers of a budget-friendly Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE (Fan Edition). This would potentially offer a more affordable entry point into the foldable phone world, similar to the strategy Samsung has used with its Galaxy S series. A recent leak suggests July 10th as the unveiling date for the Z Fold 6, alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 5..\n\nQuestion: What new foldable phone is this Electronics Brand rumoured to be launching this summer?\nAnswers:\nA.

The show had a successful run of 3 seasons before the unfortunate news was announced. Vanessa who played Jane in the show was the first woman to lead an NCIS franchise.

The outlet further reports that the finale will include a touch of foreshadowing for what was supposed to happen in a fourth season. In light of these facts on top of what went down in the Part 1 of the finale, I have some thoughts. Personally, I felt that \"Spill the Tea\" really didn't feel like the second-to-last episode of the series or Part 1 of a series finale event, but that's nobody's fault at the show. They didn't know that the end was nigh, with leading lady Vanessa Lachey even admitting she was blindsided by the cancellation. So, I can help but have my doubts about the show sticking the landing next week with an episode that feels like a proper series finale. A season finale? Sure.

Why WWE's The Undertaker Calls Triple H One Of His Favorite People To Share The Ring After an epic trilogy of WrestleMania matchups against The Undertaker, Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque could arguably be considered one of \"The Deadman's\" greatest rivals. The two WWE Hall of Famers shared many memorable moments in the ring, and The Undertaker recently revealed how much he admires the WWE CCO. Advertisement \"He was one of my favorite people to get in the ring with. We had amazing chemistry, and he just always had a good idea of the story and where it would go,\" he said on his \"Six Feet Under with Mark Calaway\" podcast. The WWE Hall of Famer explained how Triple H is and always has been a student of pro wrestling, with a humble attitude that will bode well for the company. The Undertaker does not shy away from speaking his mind now that he has retired from the WWE. The 59-year-old wrestler has seen talents from all eras of WWE, ranging from the Attitude Era to the PG Era. So, he has a sound knack for sniffing out good wrestlers from the roster over the years. Everybody knows that he has picked Shawn Michales as one of the best wrestlers in WWE. However, Taker has another wrestler also in mind, whom he calls a terrific performer in the WWE. The wrestler is none other than the phenomenal, AJ Styles. The Undertaker also had the farewell match of his against AJ Styles at WrestleMania 36. Although it wasn\u2019t a traditional match in a squared circle, it left the fans craving to see more of the two superstars get into a match. The duo not only had classic matches at WrestleMania but also battled for years and built legendary resumes off of their many bouts against each other. That is why there is no better person than \u201cThe Deadman\u201d to give his thoughts on who is the Shawn Michaels of today\u2019s WWE roster since he and Michaels worked together for the better part of 20 years. The Undertaker calls AJ Styles the Shawn Michaels of this era WWE The Undertaker was asked that question during a recent Q&A on his \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d Patreon page.

Let\u2019s unpack some more lyrics and references by Taylor Swift that hint at her time with Matty Healy in TTPD. All references to Matty Healy in Fortnight In Fortnight, Taylor sings about a temporary romance. The usage of the British term, which indicates a timespan of two weeks, has been considered by fans to be a nod to Healy. Despite their brief fling, as Swift sings \u201cAnd I love you, it\u2019s ruining my life\u201d, the song appears to confirm her strong feelings for Healy. Even a song as simple as Fresh Out of the Slammer, which comes across as a post-breakup track about regaining freedom, comes with subtle nods. The song appears to be peppered with small details of Matty and Taylor\u2019s conversations during their time together, including a suggestion that the American pop princess may have been the girl of his dreams. Singing about being at the \u201cstarting line\u201d (Healy\u2019s favourite pop-punk band), she further adds, \u201cTo the one who says I\u2019m the girl of his American dreams. \u201d Matty\u2019s bad boy reputation in I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can) As mentioned earlier, Matty Healy has been controversy\u2019s child from the beginning, and the history of his bad boy image seemingly takes centre stage in the song I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can). \u201d Evidence much? Healy\u2019s love for typewriters and Charlie Puth We bet Matty Healy didn\u2019t know back in 2019, when he revealed his love for typewriters in a GQ interview, that it would become a major reference to him in a Taylor Swift song. Whether he left his typewriter at Swift\u2019s apartment is up for speculation, but her lyrics indicate the same, with, \u201cYou left your typewriter at my apartment / Straight from the Tortured Poets Department. \u201d But this isn\u2019t the only way that she captures him in the album\u2019s title track. The other nods to Healy include his belief in Charlie Puth\u2019s talent, which dates back to 2018 when he endorsed the singer\u2019s talent on Twitter writing, \u201cCharlie Puth and Boyz II Men track is harrrrrd\u201d, possibly referring to the track If You Leave Me Now. Swifties are convinced that this is the ultimate diss track about Healy, given that it seemingly takes several jabs at him right from the first verse. The image of Matty and his 1975 bandmates performing in suits is well-known, and hence, as the lines \u201cGazing at me starry-eyed / In your Jehovah\u2019s Witness suit\u201d appear to be an obvious reference. In another verse, Taylor seems to suggest that the end of her brief relationship with Healy was the downpour on her perfect summer of Eras tour highs, with, \u201cIf rusting my sparkling summer was the goal. \u201d In several tracks, Taylor\u2019s lyrics suggest she was ghosted by The 1975 lead singer, and an example of it also appears in this track with the words, \u201cIn public, showed me off / Then sank in stoned oblivion. The black-and-white vibe of the music video and the lab coats worn by Post Malone, Ethan Hawke, and Josh Charles also seem like a nod to Healy\u2019s artistic choices as seen in his 1975 music videos. The Blue Nile fanboy in Guilty as Sin? At first glance, the song feels like it could be about any potential paramour of Swift. She sings about lusting after someone and further refers to Healy\u2019s favourite band of all time, Blue Nile, which certainly raises eyebrows. In the song, Swift sings about someone from her past sending her The Downtown Lights, a 1989 song by the Scottish band. The song, which was released in their birth year (yes, they both are 1989ers) is known to be one of Healy\u2019s favourites, and was also an inspiration for The 1975\u2019s song Love It If We Made It..\n\nQuestion: What did Taylor Swift reference in her song that is related to this Musician?\nAnswers:\nA.

The effects were significantly severe in some southern states such as Texas and Louisiana, where average travel times to the nearest abortion facility were seven hours longer, adding nearly a full workday in travel time to get an abortion. For that study, researchers considered abortion facilities in states with complete bans and those with six-week limits to be inactive. The newly implemented bans cut the number of active providers by about a tenth. In the year and a half since, the abortion landscape in the US has only become more fractured, and Florida\u2019s new six-week ban would affect a significant number of facilities that remain in the South.

(Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) Advertisement 2024 NFL draft recap: Philadelphia Eagles Share Copy Link Copy The Philadelphia Eagles entered the 2024 NFL draft with eight selections, but through various trades, they drafted nine players. WGAL is here to give you an overview of each draft pick the Eagles made over the weekend. Round 1, 22nd overall- CB Quinyon MitchellIn my opinion, the Eagles drafted the best cornerback in the 2024 draft class and didn't even need to move up to grab him. \"He was our No. 1 guy in the portal last year to try to get him to come out of the portal,\u201d Saban said, \u201cand he would never get in the portal. \u201d Mitchell showed that you can still get picked in the first round from outside the power conferences, and he'll make plenty of money in the NFL after turning money down last year. ESPN\u2019s Jordan Reid pegged Suamataia\u2019s selection as his favorite pick of the draft, citing Kansas City\u2019s ability to trust young offensive linemen to perform well early in their careers. \u201cI\u2019m going with an under-the-radar move here. In the aforementioned deep offensive tackle class, Suamataia got a bit lost in the shuffle. But he ultimately landed in the perfect spot in Kansas City,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThe Chiefs have a huge need at left tackle, and they don\u2019t shy away from playing offensive linemen early; they saw near-immediate success from Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith on the interior. So, Suamataia has the potential to contribute as a rookie. He has exciting traits, including lower-half suddenness, and certainly could develop into a dependable starter. Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde, the 33-year-old multiyear starters in Buffalo, are both gone. Poyer signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins this offseason, while Hyde is still a free agent and could rejoin the team. The two combined for over 200 starts during their seven years together in Buffalo, leaving a sizable hole in the Bills\u2019 secondary. Bishop brings youth and athleticism to Buffalo\u2019s secondary, and he\u2019ll compete with fellow safeties Taylor Rapp (who earned four starts last year and signed a three-year deal this offseason) and Mike Edwards for valuable reps. \u201cWithout Poyer and possibly Hyde for the first time since (coach Sean) McDermott and (general manager) Brandon Beane arrived, the Bills desperately needed an infusion of a high-end safety prospect that could be a long-term starter. Cornerback was clearly a need for the Eagles, even with Isaiah Rodgers coming back from suspension. Somehow, someway, after a wild start to the draft (six quarterbacks selected in the first 12 picks), Mitchell was on the board when the Eagles\u2019 22nd pick came on the clock. The Eagles must\u2019ve run to the podium because this was a no-brainer. Mitchell will likely start Day 1 in Philadelphia opposite Darius Slay, and he has the goods to become a staple in Philadelphia. He may be from Toldeo, but if you listened to the ESPN broadcast, Nick Saban mentioned Mitchell was Alabama\u2019s No. 1 target in the transfer portal, but he never entered the transfer portal. Mitchell is going to be a superstar for the Eagles. The New England Patriots made some noise in the fourth round of the NFL draft by using a pick they got in a trade with the Los Angeles Chargers on former UCF star receiver Javon Baker. After failing to land a true No. 1 veteran receiving target, the Patriots set their eyes on the draft to upgrade the skilled positions around their new rookie quarterback, Drake Maye. Baker is an explosive playmaker capable of working both outside and inside. He\u2019s also tremendous in contested catch situations. Just one look at his highlight reel is enough to see why some are so excited about his potential. Baker\u2019s confidence is unrivaled, and he plays with a level of chippiness that is uncommon in New England. In the new era of college football, it's easy for talented players at small schools to transfer to big programs and make significant NIL money. Quinyon Mitchell chose not to. Mitchell, whom the Eagles drafted out of Toledo with the 22nd pick in the draft, would have been a hot prospect in the transfer portal a year ago, but he says he didn't want to go anywhere else because he loved his coaches and teammates at Toledo, where he played his entire four-year college career. \u201cMoney and other opportunities, they\u2019re just not bigger than relationships,\u201d Mitchell told NBCSportsPhiladelphia. com. \u201cThe relationships I had at Toledo were so strong. That\u2019s why I stayed. I love those guys, I love everybody in the organization. It\u2019s just the relationships. from Ohio State. They added offensive line depth, picked a wide receiver and found some dart throws on defense in the sixth and seventh rounds. You can\u2019t be too mad given the amount of capital they held walking into the draft. They didn't have a first-round pick -- sent to the Texans for Deshaun Watson -- so they had to wait until until the 22nd pick of the second round to make a pick. That pick was Michael Hall Jr. , a defensive tackle from Ohio State. He's a good player. The rest of the draft was just OK. I'm usually a believer in taking the best prospect available -- within reason -- at most times. Don't reach for a need. Suamataia is seen as a raw talent that could take some time to develop, and in that sense, going to Kansas City poses the potential for him to get thrown into the fire too early and struggle \u2014 CBS Sports\u2019 Chris Trapasso called him a \u201cboom or bust prospect\u201d while giving his selection a B grade. Then again, there are likely to be valuable reps to be earned for the 6-foot-5, 326-pound Suamataia, who started his college career at Oregon. While Jawaan Taylor is established as the Chiefs\u2019 right tackle \u2014 he started all 17 games last season and is in the second year of a four-year contract \u2014 left tackle is open with last year\u2019s starter, Donovan Smith, currently a free agent..\n\nQuestion: Who did this NFL team select with their 22nd pick in the draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

At the very least, King can provide depth as one of the last corners on the roster, or he could make the switch to safety. Undrafted free-agent signingsKeaton Ellis, DB Tennessee TitansCurtis Jacobs, LB Kansas City Chiefs Minicamp invite Trey Potts, RB Kansas City Chiefs. Hunt has so much untapped potential, and the Eagles are the perfect spot for him to go and develop his skills for a year. Hunt is so raw, but when you watch the film, you see a player who has some special traits that need some fine tuning. Fangio will be able to use him in passing situations in 2024, and then hopefully by 2025, he reaches the potential the Eagles and I believe he has. Grade: B+ Round 4, Pick 127: Will Shipley, RB, Clemson Going back to my final mock draft again, I mentioned that running back was a sneaky need for the Eagles, and it would make sense to add one later in the draft. That is exactly what Roseman and the Eagles did. \ud83d\udc4f  \ud83d\udcfa: 2024 #NFLDraft on NFL Network/ESPN/ABC pic. twitter. com/qsFoCVcBWy \u2014 Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) April 27, 2024 After the announcement, Flores\u2019 girlfriend who accompanied him on the trip, celebrated the announcement and the efforts of the mechanical engineer who became a Cowboys fan thanks to the influence of his late father. Advertisement Flores\u2019 father, Luis Antonio Flores, launched Cowboys Nation Mx, a social media platform devoted to providing news, videos, photographs, analysis and commentary for the franchise\u2019s fans in Mexico. When his father died, Eduardo took over the operation. \u201cWhen my dad left, part of me went with him,\u201d Flores said. \u201cI was left with nobody to talk about the Cowboys. \u201d Thomas was the 233rd overall pick. With their fourth-round selection at pick 117th overall, the Indianapolis Colts selected Wisconsin interior offensive lineman Tanor Bortolini. Bortolini put together one of the best overall performances at the NFL Combine in late February and is versatile, with the ability to play all three interior positions. The Colts already have a very strong foundation set across the offensive line, with their five starters from the 2023 season returning. This was also one of the better units in football, ranking 10th in yards per carry and ninth in pressure rate allowed. However, the draft is also about planning ahead, and the addition of Bortolini is a move that\u2019s more so about 2025 and beyond. If we take a peek ahead to next offseason, both center Ryan Kelly and guard Will Fries are set to be free agents. 90 seconds. Detroit was at that workout, and assistant general manager Ray Agnew -- one of the men most responsible for the Amon-Ra St. Brown steal in the fourth round years ago -- told Holmes to pop in the tape. Holmes was so smitten by the potential upside, he woke up for the final day of the draft determined to land Manu, even if it required a move back up the board. From Tonga to a small high school outside Vancouver and then college ball at a remote outpost that had never produced an NFL draft pick, then Detroit burning a future third-rounder to get him, it doesn\u2019t get more surprising than that. Suamataia is seen as a raw talent that could take some time to develop, and in that sense, going to Kansas City poses the potential for him to get thrown into the fire too early and struggle \u2014 CBS Sports\u2019 Chris Trapasso called him a \u201cboom or bust prospect\u201d while giving his selection a B grade.

I don\u2019t know. I just know that he fits how we want to play. He\u2019s a tough, physical \u2013 he\u2019s got some dirtbag in him, and he\u2019s just one of those tough, Jersey kids that doesn\u2019t take a lot of crap. He\u2019s got some fun tape to watch and he\u2019s gone against some good defensive linemen and he\u2019s done well versus them. So, we were excited to get him. \u201d. Here\u2019s how experts graded Baker being a fourth-round pick for the Patriots:. I\u2019m still a little kind of. never thought he would be there. We couldn\u2019t be more thrilled. \u201d Biggest surprise: Go ahead and admit it. Until this weekend, you hadn\u2019t even heard of the University of British Columbia. Understandable enough. The school hadn\u2019t produced an NFL draft pick ever -- until the Lions not only selected offensive tackle Giovanni Manu in the fourth round, but traded up to do it, giving away a future third-round pick to make it happen. Crazy. Manu is a native of Tonga who moved to Canada for better educational opportunities, and was more keen on basketball until he packed on 80 pounds before his sophomore season of high school and decided to give football a try. Grade: A Round 5, Pick 155: Jeremiah Trotter Jr. , LB, Clemson This was my favorite pick of the draft, and if you\u2019re an Eagles fan, it probably was for you, too. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. played high school football at St. Joe\u2019s Prep in Philadelphia. Oh, and his father, Jeremiah Trotter, is in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame. People will talk about him being undersized, or he did not test as well in this test or that test for the combine or his pro day, I get it. You have to go through the process, and some things matter more than others. However, I also believe in everything happening for a reason, and the Eagles getting Trotter, who will wear No. 54 like his father did \u2013 it\u2019s perfect.

We wanted to add some competition at the corner position. \u201d FAMIILAR FACE The Eagles traded up Saturday to pick at No. 155 and select Clemson linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Jr. Yes, the son of that Jeremiah Trotter \u2014 an Eagles great, an All-Pro and a four-time Pro Bowl selection. The younger Trotter wears his dad\u2019s No. 54, plays the same position and celebrates sacks and big tackles with the same signature axe swing. Trotter was a finalist last year at Clemson for the Dick Butkus Award given to the best linebacker in the country. Trotter was projected to be drafted as high as the second round and some draft analysts believed only his size \u2014 he\u2019s 6-foot and 238 pounds \u2014 kept him out of the first round. A team that considers the short term, midrange and long term in its decisions stuck to its core principles. All told, the Eagles addressed their precarious secondary with their premier picks, added depth at edge rusher, running back, wide receiver and linebacker during the middle rounds, then capped off the draft with two late-round selections who will compete for the team\u2019s vacancy at right guard.

CLEMSON, SC - NOVEMBER 18: Clemson Tigers linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Jr. (54) reacts after making a tackle on defense during a college football game against the North Carolina Tar Heels on November 18, 2023 at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina. Joe Robbins/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Trotter Jr. is undersized, similar to Birds linebacker Nakobe Dean, but his football instincts will help him make an impact for the Birds on defense this upcoming season. Grade: A Round 5, Michigan guard Trevor Keegan It took the Eagles until Day 3 of the draft to address the offensive line when they selected guard Trevor Keegan out of Michigan with the 172nd overall pick. Related Utah DE Jonah Elliss continues NFL family legacy with the Denver Broncos He played defensive end at Utah, but with his 246-pound frame, Elliss projects more as an outside linebacker for the Broncos. There is plenty of competition to be had among Denver\u2019s top linebacking pass rushers \u2014 Jonathan Cooper (the team\u2019s sack leader in 2023), Nik Bonitto and Baron Browning are all on their rookie contracts, as is inside linebacker Drew Sanders. That could be both good and bad for Elliss, who had 12 sacks last season in 10 games, as he tries to establish a role early in his career with Denver; the Broncos finished tied for 21st in the league last season with 42 sacks as a team. \u201cElliss is a supercharged edge rusher with untapped potential around the corner,\u201d CBS Sports\u2019 Trapasso said. The Eagles also picked up two offensive linemen in the 2024 NFL Draft. They selected former Michigan guard Trevor Keegan in the fifth round and former N. C. State guard/center Dylan McMahon in the sixth round. Guards Landon Dickerson and Tyler Steen and center Cam Jurgens join Mailata and Johnson as the other top offensive linemen on the Eagles roster. Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde, the 33-year-old multiyear starters in Buffalo, are both gone. Poyer signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins this offseason, while Hyde is still a free agent and could rejoin the team. The two combined for over 200 starts during their seven years together in Buffalo, leaving a sizable hole in the Bills\u2019 secondary. Bishop brings youth and athleticism to Buffalo\u2019s secondary, and he\u2019ll compete with fellow safeties Taylor Rapp (who earned four starts last year and signed a three-year deal this offseason) and Mike Edwards for valuable reps. \u201cWithout Poyer and possibly Hyde for the first time since (coach Sean) McDermott and (general manager) Brandon Beane arrived, the Bills desperately needed an infusion of a high-end safety prospect that could be a long-term starter. Saquon Barkley will carry the load for the next few seasons, but if he were to miss any time, Shipley would be a guy who can step in and carry the load for a few games. Grade: B+ Round 5, Pick 152: Ainias Smith, WR, Texas A&M Ainias Smith was a guy who ranked high on my list for the Eagles because of the new offensive coordinator, Kellen Moore. Smith can play running back, slot receiver, outside receiver, kick returner, and punt returner. He is a weapon on the field, and I wanted the Eagles to get him because Moore will be able to get creative with him. That has now become a reality, and getting a receiver in the fifth round who can have an impact in a game is impressive. Smith earned First-Team All-SEC honors last season and led the team in receiving. He can also contribute in the return game on special teams and as a gadget player. COLLEGE STATION, TX - NOVEMBER 18: Texas A&M Aggies wide receiver Ainias Smith (0) warms up before the football game between the Abilene Christian Wildcats and Texas A&M Aggies at Kyle Field on November 18, 2023 in College Station, Texas. Ken Murray/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images CBS Sports had Smith's pro-comp as Houston Texans wideout Tank Dell, and if that happens, the Eagles will be more than satisfied with their fifth-round pick. Grade: B Round 5, Clemon LB Jeremiah Trotter Jr. The Eagles made a legacy pick in the fifth round by adding Clemson linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Jr. , the son of Eagles Hall of Famer Jeremiah Trotter. Trotter Jr. , a St. Suamataia is seen as a raw talent that could take some time to develop, and in that sense, going to Kansas City poses the potential for him to get thrown into the fire too early and struggle \u2014 CBS Sports\u2019 Chris Trapasso called him a \u201cboom or bust prospect\u201d while giving his selection a B grade. Then again, there are likely to be valuable reps to be earned for the 6-foot-5, 326-pound Suamataia, who started his college career at Oregon. While Jawaan Taylor is established as the Chiefs\u2019 right tackle \u2014 he started all 17 games last season and is in the second year of a four-year contract \u2014 left tackle is open with last year\u2019s starter, Donovan Smith, currently a free agent..\n\nQuestion: Who did this NFL team draft in Round 5?\nAnswers:\nA.

Israel\u2019s response to the Hamas attack had utterly derailed Israel\u2019s progress toward peaceful integrations into the Arab region \u2014 derailed especially the incipient breakthrough of normalization with Saudi Arabia. The impact of these events on Gaza is crucial, as Iran claims the Palestinian issue is central to its concerns. While detailing the repercussions of Iran\u2019s strike on Israel, ongoing Israeli atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza are highlighted. Reports of attacks on defenseless Palestinian civilians in both Gaza and the West Bank continue, underscoring the ongoing brutality faced by the Palestinian population. Inside Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government experienced a boost in popular support following the Iranian strike. Demonstrations by families of hostages held by Hamas were temporarily halted in solidarity. Tensions between the United States and Israel escalated as weapon supply discussions were sidelined, with fears raised over potential civilian casualties in Palestine. The focus on Iran has shifted attention away from the Gaza situation, as Israeli military officials found themselves fielding inquiries primarily related to Iran\u2019s actions. So Iranians will learn their homeland is now vulnerable and, for the future, no longer off limits.

It opened up a new chapter in which its own soil, thanks to its attack on Israel, is no longer off limits to any Western power. Its failure to stop a much smaller Israel response, coupled with the overwhelming success of Israel and its allies in stopping a much larger Iranian attack, reminds the Iranian autocracy that its shrill rhetoric is designed to mask its impotence and to hide its own vulnerabilities from its enemies. In particular, the Israeli Arrow-3 system proved highly effective against ballistic missiles. According to such a view, the less likely an Iranian attack was to succeed, the less likely was Israel to escalate \u2014 and thus, ironically, the more incentive Iran had to attack. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Admirabdoallahan, contended on April 14 that his country had notified the neighboring countries about the missile barrage 72 hours in advance, and assured the United States that it was to be \u201climited and minimal. \u201d That\u2019s not the kind of thing you are supposed to do if you want your attack to succeed \u2014 or if you believe that it can succeed at least in part. Whether Iran entered into such convoluted thinking or not, the fact remains that the attack took place. Avoiding a Regional War in the Middle East Good news also from the Middle East, where the week began with an Iranian attack on Israel that threatened to ignite the whole region in the level of regional war that American diplomacy has continually been striving to prevent since Iranian-backed Hamas began the cycle of violence with its assault on Israeli citizens. Israel had chosen escalation by attacking the Iranian embassy in Syria, from which it can reasonably be concluded they were inviting such that (likely disastrous) wider war with Iran. And it is reported that, indeed, the most extreme elements of Israel\u2019s ruling coalition reportedly wanted Israel to launch a massive air attack on major targets within Iran. But Israel decided instead on a path that seems to have brought this crisis to a quiet conclusion: they made a merely symbolic strike on Iran itself. Still, a realistic assessment of the nuclear situation is better than no assessment at all. Consider what is at stake. Iran, a nation for whom the possession of fully operational nuclear weapons seems to be at hand, was not deterred from launching a massive missile attack against Israel, a nation commonly described as an \u201cundeclared nuclear power\u201d and believed to have both 90 nuclear devices and appropriate vectors.

Or warnings that the United States and other powers, including several Arab States, would cooperate with Israel to neutralize a missile attack. ) And then the Iranians cooperated in stepping back from the brink, as they acted almost like nothing had happened. \u201cNo all-out regional war\u201d is big, but there\u2019s additional good news, as was well-explained by the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius: this confrontation with Iran has helped Israel recover \u2014 somewhat \u2014 from the isolation (and disgrace) Israel brought upon itself by resulting from its ugly response to the Hamas attack. Iran is the bigger problem in world politics \u2014 and a threat to Arab powers \u2014 so Iran\u2019s attack enabled Israel to regain standing with both Western allies and important neighboring Arab nations. Israel\u2019s response to the Hamas attack had utterly derailed Israel\u2019s progress toward peaceful integrations into the Arab region \u2014 derailed especially the incipient breakthrough of normalization with Saudi Arabia. London-based Iran analyst Mehrdad Khonsari told VOA that he thinks Tehran is agitating its Houthi militia proxies to keep the focus off Iran's most important regional ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon, which he thinks Israel would like to destroy or severely damage. \"Exerting pressure on the Americans and the Europeans \u2013 including raising insurance costs \u2013 are important to Iran at this time to try to prevent the Israelis or the Americans or Europeans from dealing with issues of much, much greater concerns to [Tehran]: namely the potential Israeli degradation of Hezbollah, which would mean the collapse of Iran's entire regional policy and proxy policy,\" said Khonsari. April 27, 2024 The Argentinian government is seeking the arrest of an Iranian minister for his alleged role in the bombing of a Jewish community center, a move that follows Argentina\u2019s pro-Israel shift and could complicate Iran\u2019s pursuit of friendly ties with Latin American states. In a statement Tuesday, Argentina\u2019s Foreign Ministry demanded the arrest of those responsible for the 1994 attack on the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association, specifically naming Iranian Foreign Minister Ahmad Vahidi. The ministry noted that Interpol has issued a red notice for Vahidi, and asked Pakistan and Sri Lanka to arrest Vahidi, saying he was part of an Iranian delegation currently on a visit to those countries, according to the statement. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his delegation visited Sri Lanka on Wednesday following a visit to Pakistan. When he was killed, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, described Soleimani as the architect behind the Iran-backed militia networks in the Middle East, known as the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Khamenei also said he \u201cbows to Soleimani\u201d for his achievements with the Quds Force. This illustrates the profound impact the US strike had on Iran\u2019s security interests. A recent Israeli airstrike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria\u2019s capital this month also killed seven members of the Quds force, including two generals. This led to Iran\u2019s unprecedented retaliatory attack against Israel, which Trump responded to by reposting a threatening tweet from 2018. He also said at a rally: [Israel is] under attack right now. That\u2019s because we show great weakness.

Now that the soil of both Iran and Israel is no longer sacred and immune from attack, the mystique of the Iranian nuclear threat has dissipated. It should be harder for the theocracy to shake down Western governments for hostage bribes, sanctions relief and Iran-deal giveaways on the implied threat of Iran successfully nuking the Jewish state. The new reality is that Iran has goaded an Israel that has numerous nuclear weapons and dozens of nuclear-tipped missiles in hardened silos and on submarines. Tehran has zero ability to stop any of these missiles or sophisticated fifth-generation Israeli aircraft armed with nuclear bombs and missiles. Add it all up, and the Iranian attack on Israel seems a historic blunder. It showed the world the impotence of an Iranian aerial assault at the very time it threatens to go nuclear. It revealed that an incompetent Iran may be as much a threat to itself as to its enemies. It opened up a new chapter in which its own soil, thanks to its attack on Israel, is no longer off limits to any Western power. Its failure to stop a much smaller Israel response, coupled with the overwhelming success of Israel and its allies in stopping a much larger Iranian attack, reminds the Iranian autocracy that its shrill rhetoric is designed to mask its impotence and to hide its own vulnerabilities from its enemies. When he was killed, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, described Soleimani as the architect behind the Iran-backed militia networks in the Middle East, known as the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Khamenei also said he \u201cbows to Soleimani\u201d for his achievements with the Quds Force. This illustrates the profound impact the US strike had on Iran\u2019s security interests. A recent Israeli airstrike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria\u2019s capital this month also killed seven members of the Quds force, including two generals. This led to Iran\u2019s unprecedented retaliatory attack against Israel, which Trump responded to by reposting a threatening tweet from 2018. He also said at a rally: [Israel is] under attack right now. That\u2019s because we show great weakness. [\u2026] It would not have happened if we were in office. So Iranians will learn their homeland is now vulnerable and, for the future, no longer off limits. And they will conclude that Israel has more effective allies than Iran and that their own ballistic missiles may be more suicidal than homicidal. As a result, they may conclude that the real enemies of the Iranian nation are not the Jewish people of Israel after all, but their own unhinged Islamist theocrats. Victor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness and a classicist and historian at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution. Contact him at authorvdh@gmail. com. However, Iran lives under a different nuclear culture. Its predicament is that Western countries, including Israel, can be superior in technical terms, at least temporarily, but are psychologically unable, or strategically reluctant, to \u201cthink nuclear,\u201d to envision an actual use of nuclear weapons. The ultimate rationale for nuclear weapons, in this line of reasoning, is not deterrence but blackmail. One reason why the French are truly concerned by Iran\u2019s move is that they are a middle-sized nuclear power, just like Israel. ) And then the Iranians cooperated in stepping back from the brink, as they acted almost like nothing had happened. \u201cNo all-out regional war\u201d is big, but there\u2019s additional good news, as was well-explained by the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius: this confrontation with Iran has helped Israel recover \u2014 somewhat \u2014 from the isolation (and disgrace) Israel brought upon itself by resulting from its ugly response to the Hamas attack. Iran is the bigger problem in world politics \u2014 and a threat to Arab powers \u2014 so Iran\u2019s attack enabled Israel to regain standing with both Western allies and important neighboring Arab nations. Israel\u2019s response to the Hamas attack had utterly derailed Israel\u2019s progress toward peaceful integrations into the Arab region \u2014 derailed especially the incipient breakthrough of normalization with Saudi Arabia. In particular, the Israeli Arrow-3 system proved highly effective against ballistic missiles. According to such a view, the less likely an Iranian attack was to succeed, the less likely was Israel to escalate \u2014 and thus, ironically, the more incentive Iran had to attack. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Admirabdoallahan, contended on April 14 that his country had notified the neighboring countries about the missile barrage 72 hours in advance, and assured the United States that it was to be \u201climited and minimal. \u201d That\u2019s not the kind of thing you are supposed to do if you want your attack to succeed \u2014 or if you believe that it can succeed at least in part. Whether Iran entered into such convoluted thinking or not, the fact remains that the attack took place. April 27, 2024 The Argentinian government is seeking the arrest of an Iranian minister for his alleged role in the bombing of a Jewish community center, a move that follows Argentina\u2019s pro-Israel shift and could complicate Iran\u2019s pursuit of friendly ties with Latin American states. In a statement Tuesday, Argentina\u2019s Foreign Ministry demanded the arrest of those responsible for the 1994 attack on the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association, specifically naming Iranian Foreign Minister Ahmad Vahidi. The ministry noted that Interpol has issued a red notice for Vahidi, and asked Pakistan and Sri Lanka to arrest Vahidi, saying he was part of an Iranian delegation currently on a visit to those countries, according to the statement. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his delegation visited Sri Lanka on Wednesday following a visit to Pakistan. Avoiding a Regional War in the Middle East Good news also from the Middle East, where the week began with an Iranian attack on Israel that threatened to ignite the whole region in the level of regional war that American diplomacy has continually been striving to prevent since Iranian-backed Hamas began the cycle of violence with its assault on Israeli citizens. Israel had chosen escalation by attacking the Iranian embassy in Syria, from which it can reasonably be concluded they were inviting such that (likely disastrous) wider war with Iran. And it is reported that, indeed, the most extreme elements of Israel\u2019s ruling coalition reportedly wanted Israel to launch a massive air attack on major targets within Iran. But Israel decided instead on a path that seems to have brought this crisis to a quiet conclusion: they made a merely symbolic strike on Iran itself. Still, a realistic assessment of the nuclear situation is better than no assessment at all. Consider what is at stake. Iran, a nation for whom the possession of fully operational nuclear weapons seems to be at hand, was not deterred from launching a massive missile attack against Israel, a nation commonly described as an \u201cundeclared nuclear power\u201d and believed to have both 90 nuclear devices and appropriate vectors. Clearly, the calculation behind Iran\u2019s move was that Israel\u2019s nuclear arsenal could be disregarded, even under such circumstances. There was perhaps a gamble within the gamble. One may argue that the Iranian leadership took into account beforehand Israel\u2019s top-notch anti-missile defense: the Iron Dome, David\u2019s Sling and Arrow systems. Or warnings that the United States and other powers, including several Arab States, would cooperate with Israel to neutralize a missile attack..\n\nQuestion: What does the Iranian attack on this country show?\nAnswers:\nA.

He wanted to get back to the tournament and redeem himself, and while the Owls lost in the first round to Northwestern, Goldin was terrific, scoring 19 points on 5-of-6 shooting and 9-of-11 at the free throw line to go along with nine rebounds and four blocks. Goldin is one of the best back-to-the-basket players in college basketball. Last season, he scored 1. 203 points per possession on post-ups, per Synergy. He takes pride in being able to shoot equally well with either hand and can score over either shoulder. If he gets close to the basket, he will dunk it with authority. Osobor followed Sprinkle from Montana State to Utah State this past season and went from the Big Sky Sixth Man of the Year to the top player in the Mountain West. He averaged 17. 7 points per game while grabbing nine rebounds, dishing out 2. 8 assists and blocking over one shot per game. Almost everything comes around the basket for Osobor, specifically with his back to the basket. Osobor averaged more post possessions per game this season than all but five players nationally, per Synergy. His effectiveness came as part of a Utah State offense that wasn\u2019t loaded with shot creators or outside shooters. Osobor is terrific at establishing post position deep in the paint. He uses his lack of height to his advantage, getting lower than his man to gain leverage and keep space.

But coach Penny Hardaway is still waiting on David Jones, the 21-points-per-game wing scorer seen as likely to at least test the NBA Draft waters. He needs to improve as a post-up player; he seemed to have trouble getting a foothold on the block at times. But Garrison made about 77 percent of his shots at the rim this year, and it was all those low-efficiency hook shots and midrange post jumpers that dragged his overall field goal percentage down to 57 percent. Still, he averaged 7. 5 points, 5. 3 rebounds and 1. 5 blocks per game in a loaded Big 12 that featured a ton of great bigs.

Nevertheless, he\u2019s earned the right to give it a go. It\u2019ll be intriguing to see if he follows Sprinkle again and heads to Washington. \u2014 Sam Vecenie Stats Grade High Major Year Junior Years Remaining 1 Position Forward Forward In portal Utah State Kadary Richmond Former Team Seton Hall Former Team Ht: 6-6Wt: 210 The Big East first-teamer is one of the more unique players in college basketball. Richmond is a big point guard with terrific vision who goes against the grain when it comes to analytics. He shoots a lot of mid-rangers and isn\u2019t a good 3-point shooter \u2014 33. 7 percent for his career. He fills the stat sheet: 15. 7 points, 7. 0 rebounds, 5. 1 assists and 2. 2 steals per game. But Osobor does more than just post. He corralled more than 10 percent of his team\u2019s misses with either put-backs or tip-outs. He has an excellent understanding of passing angles and can make sharp reads from a standstill position or on the move. He excelled at finding cutters himself and was really capable as a playmaker going in either direction. His hands are enormous, and he has full control over the ball while making his moves. Osobor is a center, and there are some inherent defensive limitations that come when a 6-foot-8 person plays that position. He moves well enough on the perimeter to run different defensive coverages, and he\u2019s a willing, physical player on the interior. He developed into a star for the Owls and was motivated last offseason after a disappointing finish in the Final Four, when he scored only five points in the team\u2019s loss to San Diego State. He wanted to get back to the tournament and redeem himself, and while the Owls lost in the first round to Northwestern, Goldin was terrific, scoring 19 points on 5-of-6 shooting and 9-of-11 at the free throw line to go along with nine rebounds and four blocks. Goldin is one of the best back-to-the-basket players in college basketball. Last season, he scored 1. 203 points per possession on post-ups, per Synergy. He takes pride in being able to shoot equally well with either hand and can score over either shoulder. If he gets close to the basket, he will dunk it with authority. BYU guard Dallin Hall heard from the Duke basketball staff and others but has decided to remain a Cougar. Last week, Duke basketball popped up on the list of 10 programs that Dallin Hall was reportedly considering after entering the transfer portal earlier this month. But as is the case with several other veteran guards who have drawn interest from the Blue Devils during this hectic offseason in Durham, the BYU sophomore is no longer a possibility for Jon Scheyer and his crew. On Friday, Hall announced his decision to return to BYU for his junior campaign, despite former Cougar head coach Mark Pope's move to Kentucky. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound talent was a hot commodity across his two-week stay in the transfer portal, largely due to his high-IQ playmaking abilities and experience via 51 starts in 68 appearances between his first two years in Provo, Utah. The lefty guard can score from all three levels in the pick-and-roll. If he cannot find an easy bucket in transition, he\u2019ll quickly use a ball screen to try to get into the teeth of the defense. He attempted about three shots at the rim per game in halfcourt situations this season, per Synergy, and used an occasional floater or pull-up midrange jumper as a counter. When opponents went under his screens, he comfortably stopped and popped from distance, making about one pull-up 3 per game. But Mack is especially appealing for a high-major school because he combines that skill with a strong off-ball game. Harvard used him to attack off the catch a fair amount last season, allowing him to generate spot-up 3s, midrange jumpers or drives all the way to the rim when opponents closed out aggressively. He made eight 3s in the Sweet 16 game against North Carolina and then followed that up with eight assists in the Elite Eight against Clemson. This is a surprising one because he\u2019s such a good fit in Alabama\u2019s system and started 33 games this season. \u2014 C. J.

He\u2019s limited as an athlete but seems to realize his limitations and play to his strengths. ) Dajuan Harris and Kevin McCullar lacked pull-up shooting gravity, and Elmarko Jackson wasn\u2019t ready yet. Pull-up shooting is exactly what Mayo brings to the table. He fills both a positional and significant skill-based need that should give Self more flexibility when constructing the team\u2019s offensive system next season. If Hunter Dickinson returns, he and Mayo could execute all sorts of dribble hand-off actions that will be challenging to defend. Kansas has a few things left to fix from last season\u2019s disappointment, but Mayo is about as good a start in the portal as they could have hoped. They didn\u2019t recruit them in the home and then they didn\u2019t have them for three or four years and watch them grow. \u201cSo they may have had them for six months, because they transferred in and that\u2019s what they had them for. So our guys have really kind of had to get outside their comfort zone and their boundaries to find these things out, and they\u2019ve done a wonderful job of it. And we\u2019ve really pushed them to do so, and they\u2019ve done an excellent job. \u201d In Gutekunst\u2019s words, the locker room environment can be \u201cfragile. \u201d So being mindful of who is added to it is always front of mind for him. And year in and out, he\u2019s remained a significant piece for coach Brian Scholly\u2019s State High basketball program. \u201cThe best thing about him is he doesn\u2019t really care about (individual accolades), he wants to help the team win,\u201d said Kaluza, the coach who works with him most closely this time of year. State College\u2019s Ty Salazer cuts down the field with the ball around a Red Land defender during the game on Thursday, April 25, 2024. Abby Drey/adrey@centredaily. com Salazer continued playing multiple sports from when he was a kid.

She received MVP votes every year of her professional career, winning the award in 2014 after earning the 2013 Finals MVP. Her career average of 18. 4 points per game still ranks top 10 in league history. Moore\u2019s college resume is just as impressive. She led UConn to back-to-back NCAA championships in 2009-10, and she was the Naismith Player of the Year in both 2009 and 2011. Moore still holds program records for career points per game, field goals made, and single-season points, and she remains the only Huskies player to score 3,000 career points.

But Garrison made about 77 percent of his shots at the rim this year, and it was all those low-efficiency hook shots and midrange post jumpers that dragged his overall field goal percentage down to 57 percent. Still, he averaged 7. 5 points, 5. 3 rebounds and 1. 5 blocks per game in a loaded Big 12 that featured a ton of great bigs.

At Monday\u2019s ceremony naming the gymnasium for longtime Randall High coach Leslie Broadhurst, Thomas reflected on his playing career with Randall High School and his journey going forward with college basketball with the Miners. \u201cThese last two years have been very special for me,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cMy junior year, this was the first time the team has ever been to state. That was a great team that really struggled at the beginning of the year, but we really picked it up. Just making that trip down there was fantastic. Continuing that was my senior year; going to state again was awesome. We fell a little short of our goals, but I would not want to do that with any other team. Defensively, Avila knows where to be, but his foot speed and lack of jumping ability limits how you can play on that end. Indiana State played Avila in drop coverage and tried to keep everything in front. He does a good job of not fouling \u2014 3. 4 fouls per 40 \u2014 but Indiana State\u2019s defense ranked 114th in adjusted efficiency. There\u2019s a ceiling there, but he was also the hub of one of the best offenses in the country. He reminds me a lot of Georges Niang, the former Iowa State big who helped lead the Cyclones to two Sweet 16s and was the hub of a top-12 offense in all four of his seasons in Ames. The Sycamores, in case you were wondering, ranked 13th in adjusted offense this year. \u2014 C. J. Moore \u2014 C. J. But after Wisconsin Athletics announced in a release on Nov. 1 that the freshman would take a temporary leave of absence from the program, Yalden\u2019s path to a first-year impact grew more complicated and ultimately never came to fruition. Yalden was one of the marquee members of the Badgers' 2023 recruiting class, committing in May 2022 to the school he rooted for throughout his childhood. He played his senior season at La Lumiere School in LaPorte, Indiana, and was a consensus four-star and top-125 recruit in the country by all three major recruiting services.

But Johnson seemed like a prime candidate to emerge as a star coming into the year, and he instead fell back into his defensive-oriented secondary role amid all of the Trojans\u2019 ballhandlers. Johnson started the year strongly and ended it with a flurry, too. In his first 13 games, Johnson averaged nearly 12 points, five rebounds and 3. 5 assists per game. In his final eight games, which included five Trojan wins, Johnson averaged 12. 9 points, 5. 3 rebounds, three assists and 3. 3 steals while posting shooting marks of 50 percent from the field, 45 percent from 3 and 75 from the free-throw line. \u201cI will say I am a leader, and I can get my teammates involved and score when I need to,\u201d he said. \u201cI am an all-around player and a winner.

But after drafting Maye, Washington wide receiver Ja\u2019Lynn Polk (an offseason-workout partner of Baker\u2019s) and him, Baker said New England was going to get turned around. \u201cUs three alone just going to bring back the winning mentality that everybody like in Boston,\u201d Baker said. New England likes that it has \u201ca couple of guys who can grow with Drake\u201d for the next four years, said Matt Groh, the Patriots\u2019 director of player personnel. \u201cThis is a kid who went to Alabama,\u201d Groh said.

(AP Photo/Matt Freed) (Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. ) Elliott was previously released by Dallas in the 2023 offseason after seven seasons with the team. He was the fourth selection overall in the 2016 NFL Draft. In his career, he\u2019s rushed for 8,904 yards and 71 touchdowns. He\u2019ll join a Cowboys\u2019 backfield that is in search of a true number one option and will be part of a depth chart that currently includes Rico Dowdle, Deuce Vaughn and Royce Freeman. Previous starter Tony Pollard left after agreeing to terms with the Tennessee Titans. He recently agreed to terms on a one-year contract and his roster return is scheduled to become official following a physical. Advertisement Where does he fit in the running back room? This remains to be seen. He is certainly the biggest name in the room, joining veteran Royce Freeman, Rico Dowdle, Deuce Vaughn, Hunter Luepke, Malik Davis, Snoop Conner and undrafted rookie Nathaniel Peat. Whether he has anything left in the tank is certainly the biggest question on everyone\u2019s mind, however, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones recently told reporters he sees remaining tread on Elliott\u2019s tires.

He was the leading rusher on a bad Patriots offense, posting 642 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 184 carries. Elliott, who turns 29 in July, joins a backfield in Dallas that currently features Rico Dowdle, Deuce Vaughn, Royce Freeman, Malik Davis, Snoop Conner and Nathaniel Peat. Cole Bishop, S, Utah For a variety of reasons, Bishop heading to Buffalo is intriguing. The Bills drafted him with the 60th overall selection in the second round, a spot the talented former Ute had been linked to in a variety of mock drafts. For starters, he\u2019s reuniting with former Utah teammate Dalton Kincaid, a 2023 first-rounder who made a big impact as a rookie at tight end. \u201cI got to meet with them a couple of times during the combine \u2026 then having a couple Zooms throughout the process with my guy Dalton out there.

The WNBA has 144 spots, and some teams use fewer than the allotted 12 spots for many reasons, including managing the league's salary cap. With only one spot available for the Sun, she is mainly competing against a number of players who are more experienced; Connecticut only brought one more rookie into cap in 6-6 center Taiyanna Jackson out of Kansas. For now, Pueyo is focused on the things that brought her to Connecticut. She returned to the Wildcats for a fifth year this past season to have this opportunity to compete for her place in the WNBA. She averaged 7. 7 PPG, 3. 0 RPG, and 2. 0 APG in 26. 1 MPG and even worked herself up to a spot in the starting lineup. The 28-year-old was rewarded with her first multi-year contract, the first that guaranteed Samuelson for an entire season. She's one of the best 3-point shooters in the league, and the Mystics are desperately in need of perimeter shooting since they'll be without Delle Donne. Don't overlook Samuelson in fantasy drafts. \u201cSomebody who can be efficient with the number of touches that they get was important for us because in our system with our veterans \u2014 and I mean, we only have one spot on our team really that is open \u2014 we have to have somebody who understands how to move the ball, how to get the ball in position to score and who might not get a lot of touches but can be impactful.

TURN ME UP. pic. twitter. com/wrFXvXoL4m \u2014 Phoenix Mercury (@PhoenixMercury) April 30, 2024 \"Before that point I thought was ready for the WNBA, then got there and realised how not ready I was. The difference between college and the WNBA is crazy - the athletes, the physicality, the IQ. Everything is a whole step up that I kind of didn't expect. \"It was a huge jump and I think in the end I realised I wasn't as ready as I thought which is why it kind of ended the way it did, but I definitely feel more prepared this time. \" Atwell returns to the U. S. White has seen Pueyo up close in McKale Center for the last few years when she was an analyst on some ofArizona\u2019s nationally televised games. She liked what she saw \u2014 all the little things that are pure Pueyo. Pueyo is someone who can \u201cimpact winning in ways outside of the stat sheet,\" White said. \u201cWe've got enough scorers on our team; we got a veteran group,\u201d White added. \u201cOn the offensive end it was it was more the way she moves the ball. She's a player who had, up until that point, a lower usage rate but a high assist percentage. Ahead of the 2024 WNBA Draft, former UCLA Bruins All-Pac-12 shooting guard Charisma Osborne was seen as a potential late first round or early second round selection by a variety of pundits and mock drafts. But teams, evidently, did not agree. The 5-foot-9 Fontana native survived all the way till the third round this year. She was selected with the No. 25 pick by the Phoenix Mercury (the first pick of the third round), a once-proud club that has fallen on lean times in recent years. Now, the two time Pac-12 All-Defensive Teamer will join a veteran-heavy squad that also includes future Hall of Famers Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner, plus former Finals MVP Kahleah Copper. I think that's the difference right now. \u201cYou play against such talented players. Here, if you don\u2019t play defense, you cannot be here. I think everybody is doing a step up on defense first, because as they say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to play defense to be able to play offense and just to be able to play here. \u2019\u201d Defense was one of Pueyo\u2019s calling cards at Arizona. She used her length to narrow the passing lanes and force deflections. In the Spaniard\u2019s fifth year as a Wildcat, she collected a career-high 110 steals \u2014 the first Pac-12 player with more than 100 steals in a single season since 2017-18 \u2014 and fourth all-time in league history. Pueyo, nicknamed by her Wildcat teammates \u201cCookie Monster\u201d (she called getting steals eating cookies), also became UA\u2019s career steals leader with 312. 3 and 13 selections to the Chicago Sky in an offseason trade to acquire Copper. #Mercury coach Nate Tibbetts on drafting Charisma Osborne in #wnba third round pic. twitter. com/fxw1PNgrI4 \u2014 jeffmetcalfe (@jeffmetcalfe) April 29, 2024 \"Nick [general manager Nick U\u2019Ren] and his group, they were ready on draft night,\" Tibbetts said. \"They were extremely prepared.

Longo talks about Tyler Van Dyke\u2019s progression Tyler Van Dyke, who transferred from Miami, and Braedyn Locke have each received first-team reps through 13 practices. Van Dyke\u2019s taken noticeable steps starting with the April 20 practice, and he again sprayed the ball to receiving targets and made plays in the run game Saturday. He said he also holds six FBS offers as of last week that include Boston College, Pitt, Temple, Rutgers, Wake Forest and Syracuse. He\u2019s taken unofficial visits to Boston College, Syracuse, Wake Forest, Wisconsin and Rutgers this spring. How the Badgers have recruited him early on in his process has left an imprint. \u201cIt's had a very deep impression on me that these coaches, they seem to like me a lot and they took the time to be with me on my visit, but I've also been talking to them a little bit outside of the visit, too,\u201d Funke said. \u201cAnd I think just reaching out that early just shows their interest level and makes me feel more interested in the school, too, if I have that interest level from them. Always going to keep our ear to the pavement and be open to everything. In terms of Miles, we love Miles. We see a big role for him. I think Dave would tell you the same, that we think really highly of Miles. We love Miles. He can do a lot for our offense. He's versatile in the pass game and a really good runner. So, we're excited about him as well. \" Where this roster is compared to last year's Dan Morgan: \"Definitely not going to get into comparisons.

We just really kind of did whatever we thought we were called to do in that moment. \u201cAnd I just learned that Julie would be successful at whatever she does. \u201d Now the Rhules are betting that the move to Lincoln will be lengthy.

Foster is endearing himself to the fan base quite well. Things are different in Westwood nowadays. When athletic director Martin Jarmond opted to hire DeShaun Foster as the UCLA Bruins football coach, more than a few eyebrows were raised. Foster had no head coaching experience prior to landing the gig. The thought of reversing the fortunes of this program was also daunting. Objectively speaking, Chip Kelly cratered the program -- and robbed any joy it once had. Suffice it to say, but Foster has his work cut out for himself. On Saturday, UCLA held its Spring Showcase. The team was having somewhat of a scripted game out at the Rose Bowl with reportedly close to 20,000 in attendance. Lunch was served inside one of the major donor tents. A season in coordinator Phil Longo\u2019s offense is leading to more production this spring for the University of Wisconsin football team to start Year 2. There was a lot of hype surrounding the arrival of an Air Raid scheme at this time last year with Longo coming over from North Carolina. With key injuries hitting during the season, along with the adjustment to a new offense, Wisconsin averaged only 23. 5 points and 380. 5 yards per game in 2023. Its ReliaQuest Bowl performance of 378 yards passing and 128 yards rushing against LSU on Jan. 1 provided a glimpse of what this unit could be. It\u2019s no coincidence the offense has looked more comfortable and produced more this spring heading into Longo\u2019s second season. Saturday\u2019s scrimmage, with more than a handful of touchdowns and multiple explosive plays, showed that. Brand new staff, brand new head coach, it's not always going to be perfect.

The staff he's put together is approaching this job with tons of energy and effort. This extends to community outreach, the fan base, and also in regards to recruiting. Instead of going through the motions, or operating with unnecessary secrecy, the program has been made accessible to everyone. This also includes ex-players who are welcomed back with open arms. Plenty of work has to be done to make UCLA a bowl team this year.

The Indiana Fever rookie guard, who was drafted into the WNBA with the No. 1 overall pick earlier this month, has been watching the blue and gold on multiple occasions. The Fever star met Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton and gushed about his playing abilities. They play the same position and are both excellent passers, so they quickly bonded \u2014 at least once they got over the fact that they attended rival colleges. Haliburton went to Iowa State University while Clark went to the University of Iowa. \"The thing I love about him is the way he passes the ball. I watch his game and it's just incredible what he can do,\" Clark said of Haliburton last week. 5 points, 8. 4 rebounds, 2. 2 assists, 1. 3 blocks and 1. 3 steals per game. In addition to being named the WNBA Rookie of the Year, Boston was also a WNBA All-Star and was named to the All-Rookie team. Fever general manager Lin Dunn understands how having the No. 1 pick in back-to-back seasons can be a franchise-changing situation. She talked about that aspect in February after Indiana learned its fate in this year's draft. \"Fortunately, I've had that experience with two, back-to-back first round picks,\" said Dunn, reflecting on her time with the Seattle Storm. \"It's been a long time, but I know what an impact it can have on a franchise, when we were able to select Lauren Jackson (2001) and Sue Bird (2002). The rest is history. Caitlin Clark\u2019s new teammate, Erica Wheeler, has made it her mission to welcome Caitlin with open arms to the WNBA. And the reason why Wheeler has gone above and beyond for the No. 1 pick is so incredibly heartwarming. Erica Wheeler has been hyped about Caitlin Clark joining the Indiana Fever long before Caitlin arrived. She\u2019s been tweeting about Clark for months and even came wholesomely unglued when Caitlin was drafted. None of that awesome energy from Erica changed when training camp started just days ago. In fact, Wheeler explained that she felt it was her duty as Caitlin\u2019s vet to step up to support her, even if that meant Wheeler would lose her spot as starting point guard. Here\u2019s what Erica told the media on Monday: \u201cI just wanted to get ahead of it because I know this transition is tough. In her senior season, Clark averaged 31. 6 points, 8. 9 assists and 7. 4 rebounds per game. She helped lead the Hawkeyes to a 34-5 record, which included a 15-3 mark in Big Ten play. Although Iowa did not win the Big Ten regular season crown, it did win its third straight conference tournament championship. The Hawkeyes also earned a trip to the national championship game for a second consecutive season. Iowa was defeated by an undefeated South Carolina squad, despite a performance from Clark that included 30 points, eight rebounds and five assists. With Clark heading to the Fever, she'll team up with last year's WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston. The South Carolina product was the top overall selection in the 2023 WNBA Draft. Boston put together an impressive rookie campaign in her first season in the league. The Indiana Fever selected Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft. The former Hawkeye joins last year's No. 1 pick, Aliyah Boston (South Carolina), in Indianapolis. Caitlin Clark is officially heading to the Indiana Fever. The two-time Naismith National Player of the Year was selected with the No. 1 overall pick in Monday night's 2024 WNBA Draft. The selection comes as no surprise, as Clark has been the projected No. 1 pick since before the start of the 2023-24 women's college basketball season. the Iowa standout only solidified her status as the top player available in this year's class with her play. Clark became the NCAA's all-time leading scorer for both women's and men's college basketball. \u201d Indiana Fever players Aliyah Boston (left) and Caitlin Clark stand on the court for a t-shirt toss Friday, April 26, 2024, during the game against the Milwaukee Bucks at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. During the game, she even reached out of the booth she was in to sign an ultrasound. \u201cEveryone sees it, the energy, the eyes, everyone\u2019s cheering for her,\u201d Fever center Aliyah Boston said. \u201cI mean, she signed an ultrasound, did you guys see that on social media? An ultrasound? Congrats to the lady, but dang. \u201d And while Clark is used to crowds (Iowa sold out every home game this past season), some of her teammates haven\u2019t seen crowds like this for a while, if ever. The Fever ranked 11th in attendance in 2023, drawing an average of 4,067 fans per game. Clark joining the Fever as the No. I think oftentimes people forget I\u2019m a great person before a basketball player. \u201d \u201cAs a big sister, I\u2019m going to take the first step first to just let her know, \u2018We\u2019re here.

Following Friday's off day, the Astros demolished the Colorado Rockies during their two-game weekend series, outscoring them 20-6 and earning their first series sweep of the season. This team still stinks, but the Sox gave their fans a weekend to remember. Astros at Rockies: Eight home runs have been hit at least 455 feet so far this season; four of those were hit this past weekend in the comically homer-happy environs of Estadio Alfredo Harp Helu in Mexico City. The Mexican capital is around 7,350 feet above sea level \u2014 or 2,000 feet closer to the heavens than Coors Field in Denver. Both clubs took advantage of the thin air this weekend, but Houston dusted Colorado in the two-game set. It was a much-needed salve for the scuffling Stros, who saw Framber Valdez return from the shelf with a sensational start Sunday. The Rockies, meanwhile, became the first team in baseball history to trail in their first 28 games. \u201cWe will continue to play hard. \u201d Houston had lost five in a row before arriving in Mexico City, scoring a total of 10 runs during the slide.

The Boston Celtics won Game 4 of their 2024 NBA Eastern Conference first round series with the Miami Heat to take a commanding 3-1 lead at Kaseya Center on Monday night, but the win came at a cost.

The hosts of the CLNS Media \u201cCeltics Lab\u201d podcast took a deep dive into Boston\u2019s Game 4 results and what it means for the team moving forward. Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo and Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum were involved in a weird incident Monday in the fourth quarter of Game 4. It began with Heat guard Patty Mills being called for a foul after accidentally tripping Celtics guard Derrick White. After the whistle blew, Tatum attempted to shoot a 3-pointer. Adebayo responded by contesting the shot, which caused Tatum to roll his ankle. He fell on the court clutching the ankle. The referees then called a Flagrant 1 on Adebayo. Celtics center Al Horford was then given a technical for shoving Adebayo. At the time, the Heat were making a comeback but were still down 91-78. Tatum then made two free throws as part of the technical with 5 minutes, 4 seconds remaining. \u201cI don\u2019t even know dawg,\" Adebayo said when asked for an explanation. The Boston Celtics were given a major scare when Kristaps Porzingis pulled up with a non-contact injury during the second quarter against the Miami Heat on Monday night. Porzingis exited the game and did not return, and though he'll receive a more detailed update on the calf injury on Tuesday, he shared an uplifting message on social media after the Celtics' 102\u201388 win in Game 4.

Coach Joe Mazzulla had no immediate update on the Porzingis\u2019s prognosis, but the 7-foot-2-inch center is expected to undergo an MRI on Tuesday. The Celtics sounded hopeful, but not tremendously optimistic. \u201cWorried, just concerned,\u201d said Al Horford, who will fill in at center while Porzingis is sidelined. \u201cAny time that any of your guys go back there, especially him, the way that he was walking, is definitely concerning for me. \u201d Added Jayson Tatum: \u201cI hope it\u2019s not too serious.

And it was not simply a matter of feasting while Miami\u2019s defense shaded toward Boston\u2019s bigger stars. White poured in deep, contested 3-pointers, rumbled down the lane for two-handed dunks in traffic, and stayed in command throughout.

Pitts, the No. 4 pick in the 2021 NFL draft, has put together a pair of disappointing seasons since his breakout rookie campaign. He recorded 53 receptions for 667 yards and three touchdowns in 2023, at times taking a backseat to fellow tight end Jonnu Smith. The Falcons fired coach Arthur Smith in a move they hope will ultimately allow Pitts to emerge into one of the sport's premier pass-catching tight ends. Pitts recorded 68 receptions for 1,026 yards and a touchdown as a rookie in 2021, becoming the second rookie tight end in NFL history to top the 1,000-yard mark. He faces competition from Bartch, Kingston, Zakelj and others for a roster spot. Moore figures to be in line to serve as the swing tackle, though Parker could play his way into a spot as McKivitz\u2019s backup on the right side. Defensive line Projected depth chart Nick Bosa, Javon Hargrave, Maliek Collins, Leonard Floyd, Yetur Gross-Matos, Jordan Elliott, Kevin Givens, Drake Jackson, Kalia Davis, Robert Beal, T. Y. McGill, Austin Bryant, Alex Barrett, Spencer Waege, Raymond Johnson, Sam Okuayinonu, Earnest Brown, #Evan Anderson Overview The 49ers did not use a draft pick on a defensive lineman for only the second time in the past 14 years. After identifying there would not be a lot of answers in this draft, the 49ers went hard in free agency to fill their needs. Penix will be his successor, even though he is already 23 years old. It was quite the reach! Herein lies the irony. Fontenot used that exact word \u2014 reach \u2014 in a negative capacity to discuss another befuddling NFL Draft decision. Defensive back was a glaring position of need for Atlanta. The Falcons need a corner. They did not draft one. Why? Because Fontenot didn\u2019t want to reach. Seriously! We would have liked to add that position, but you don\u2019t want to force a reach or do something you shouldn\u2019t. \u2014 Terry Fontenot Atlanta\u2019s general manager did not want to \u201cforce a reach\u201d at one of the deepest positions in this year\u2019s NFL Draft class, which is also of need for the organization. Didn't work out at corner, but we'll continue to look. \u201d Morris noted the Falcons signed a pair of cornerbacks this spring in Antonio Hamilton and Kevin King, and he singled out several returners behind Terrell in Clark Phillips III, Mike Hughes, Dee Alford and Natrone Brooks. At the league owners meetings in March, Morris said Hughes was a pleasant surprise on film and the 5-10, 183-pound Phillips impressed working both inside and outside. Morris dubbed Alford as a nickel corner but also feels he can play safety if needed. Thus, while the Falcons\u2019 eight-man draft class is void of defensive backs, Morris is unconcerned. \u201cWe feel really good about a lot of those things,\u201d Morris said. Still, Atlanta\u2019s not definitively done adding to its secondary. Options exist to add players. The Falcons have just $5. Atlanta Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot entered the NFL Draft wanting to acquire another piece on the back end, he departed empty handed. When the 2024 NFL Draft reached pick No. 8 overall, the Atlanta Falcons had their choice at the class\u2019s top defensive players. But instead of trading back and addressing question marks along the defensive line or in the secondary, Atlanta chose to quell any future concerns at quarterback, selecting Washington signal caller Michael Penix Jr. The Falcons used their next three picks \u2013 four of their final seven overall \u2013 to bolster their pass rush but failed to add competition to a cornerbacks room littered with uncertainty after starter A. J. Terrell. And according to general manager Terry Fontenot, walking out of the draft empty handed at corner isn\u2019t necessarily what the Falcons set out to do. Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde, the 33-year-old multiyear starters in Buffalo, are both gone. Poyer signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins this offseason, while Hyde is still a free agent and could rejoin the team. The two combined for over 200 starts during their seven years together in Buffalo, leaving a sizable hole in the Bills\u2019 secondary. Bishop brings youth and athleticism to Buffalo\u2019s secondary, and he\u2019ll compete with fellow safeties Taylor Rapp (who earned four starts last year and signed a three-year deal this offseason) and Mike Edwards for valuable reps. \u201cWithout Poyer and possibly Hyde for the first time since (coach Sean) McDermott and (general manager) Brandon Beane arrived, the Bills desperately needed an infusion of a high-end safety prospect that could be a long-term starter. Austin Corbett is making the move from guard to center this offseason and is projected to be the Panthers' starter there. Given his recent injury history, the Panthers need to have a solid plan in place incase injury issues arise once again. Carolina passed on taking a center in the 2024 NFL Draft despite having interest in Jackson Powers-Johnson (Oregon) and Zach Frazier (West Virginia), who were widely regarded as the top two center prospects in this year's class. For now, they'll be repping Brady Christensen there, who has served time at tackle and guard during his first three years in the organization. \"Yeah, you know, I think I said before we feel really good about Austin Corbett there at center,\" said GM Dan Morgan on Saturday. \"I think he's progressing well, and I think Dave (Canales) would say the same thing to you guys..\n\nQuestion: What position did this NFL team fail to address in the NFL Draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

OL Giovanni Manu, University of British Columbia This was the biggest head-scratching pick of the Lions\u2019 entire draft for me. There\u2019s no doubt that Manu, standing in at 6-foot-7 and 352 pounds, is gifted with some great intangibles. For instance, he possesses an uncanny degree of speed for a man of his size, having posted a 4. 96 40-yard dash at his pro day. However, it\u2019s also true that the University of British Columbia product has never played a down of football in the U. S. , and is an extremely raw prospect. Wingo, whom the Lions traded up to get at No. 189 overall in the sixth round, has all the makings of a disruptive force along the interior of the defensive line. The LSU product, who was originally projected as a Day 2 pick, was a team captain for the Tigers in 2023. The 6-foot, 284-pounder accumulated 98 total tackles, including 13 for loss, and 8. 5 sacks in three collegiate seasons (one at Missouri and two at LSU). Wingo, at the very least, has what it takes to be a solid backup 3-technique. And, he certainly has the potential to grow into a three-down player and starting interior defensive lineman. It makes him an awesome value pick for the Lions at this advanced stage in the draft. 3. \u201cThey allowed me to be the central piece of their offense and I think we did that and that they got me the ball in space, got me the ball in ways that I was best at, so we saw an increase in numbers, volume and a better product than the year before. \u201d Washington, as a sixth-rounder who before the NFL Draft was projected to be taken as early as late in the third round, won\u2019t be just handed a role in Miami. McDaniel said Washington and Miami\u2019s six other draft picks will have to earn their responsibilities. Aside from Hill and Waddle, who each caught passes for over 1,000 yards last year, Miami has veterans Braxton Berrios and River Cracraft as well as seventh-round pick Tahj Washington, out of Southern California, for Malik Washington to compete with. While the Lions plan to utilize him on offense, there\u2019s always a chance he could return to his roots defensively. \u201cI feel like it gives me a lot of upside, just \u2013 the coaches are able to mold me into whatever they want me to be,\u201d Vaki said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a kid who comes from hard work and putting my head down and giving 110 percent effort in wherever I stand. So, when it comes to the organization, they\u2019re getting everything that I got, so I feel like it brings a lot of upside to not only myself, but the organization itself. \u201d This article was produced by the staff at Sports Illustrated/All Lions.

Picked by the Lions at No. 61 overall, Rakestraw was viewed by a variety of pundits as a first-round prospect earlier in the pre-draft process. Much like Detroit's first-round pick, Terrion Arnold, the Missouri product has the ability to impact the game both in coverage and as a run-defender. For starters, Rakestraw is equipped with a top-notch football IQ and high-end press-man coverage skills. In fact, during his time with the Tigers, he showcased the ability to defend receivers both in the slot and on the perimeter. In 36 career games at Missouri, he totaled 107 tackles, including eight tackles for loss, 24 passes defensed and one interception. Additionally, the ultra physical Rakestraw isn't afraid to come up and make a tackle, and should fit right in with Aaron Glenn's \u201cviolent\u201d defense.

This is important when scanning the football landscape and how it is going to change. With Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool swansong potentially ending in disappointment, the Merseyside club are preparing ahead for next season, with reports suggesting the club are close to bringing in Dutchman Arne Slot as his successor at Anfield. The 45-year-old currently manages Eredivisie club Feyenoord, which sits second in the league and has lost only two matches this season. A brief history of Arne Slot Arend Martijn \u201cArne\u201d Slot was born on September 17, 1978, in the small village of Bergentheim in the Netherlands. As a player, he was a talented but anxious midfielder who mostly played in the Dutch lower leagues. His love for the game began in his hometown Bergentheim, starting his journey at amateur side VV Bergentheim. Slot later joined the FC Zwolle academy, making the first team at 17 in 1995. Ten Hag's side have now failed to win five of their last six league games, conceding 12 goals during that run, but the manager has defended United's performances of late.

I\u2019m more than happy, it sounds all really good. \u201d Asked about the job Slot would be taking on if appointed, Klopp added: \u201cBest job in the world, best club in the world. Now it looks like [Slot is] helped by [Liverpool] not finishing on a high so there\u2019s space for improvement. \u201d A former midfielder, Slot spent his entire playing career in the Netherlands, making more than 100 appearances for both FC Zwolle and NAC Breda. After retiring from playing, he began his coaching career as a youth coach at PEC Zwolle before moving to SC Cambuur to become an assistant manager. He moved to AZ Alkmaar in 2017 and stepped up to become manager two years later.

It means there is no massive tactical upheaval or adaptation. Liverpool have one vision and playing style running through all age groups, which dictates the stylistic profile they recruit for, so it is sensible to continue with that.

But they felt less significant than the loud boos that had reverberated around Old Trafford when Ten Hag opted to bring off Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo in the 65th minute. In fairness to Ten Hag, both players looked spent but the home supporters showed little enthusiasm for the decision and let their feelings be known. It is the third time this season Ten Hag has been rebuked by the Old Trafford crowd for a substitution after similar reactions against Brighton and Manchester City early in the season and such an open show of defiance is not a good look.

Several theories have been raised over the cause of Mohamed Salah\u2019s furious bust-up on the side of the pitch with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp , but new reports claim that it was due to a handshake snub. The Egyptian star was about to be brought on as a substitute in the 2-2 draw with West Ham when his outgoing head coach is said to have felt aggrieved by their interaction on the sideline. Salah flew in the face of Liverpool dressing room job given to him by Klopp Salah and Klopp could be seen arguing moments before the winger was brought onto the pitch, having been dropped from the starting lineup for the trip to West Ham. They were involved in an animated spat next to the fourth official, with Klopp appearing to go over to Salah to embrace him but was shunned. \u201d Footage of Salah walking through the \u2018mixed zone,\u2019 an area inside a stadium where journalists can speak to players, was widely shared on social media with the striker telling one reporter as he walked by that there would be \u201cfire\u201d if he spoke.

The lesson? Do not leave Jurgen Norbert Klopp hanging. Plenty has been said already with Salah\u2019s long-term future at Anfield in serious doubt. Incoming Liverpool manager Arne Slot has made his feelings extremely clear on Mohamed Salah\u2019s future. The Egyptian has already cemented his status as a Liverpool legend during Jurgen Klopp\u2019s tenue at Anfield but his future has been plunged into doubt after a touchline row with his manager against West Ham on Saturday. Salah and Klopp clashed after the forward was dropped to the bench for the game against the Hammers amid a poor spell of form after returning from the Africa Cup of Nations. Advert The 31-year-old has scored just five goals in his last 13 appearances, two of which have been penalties, and his fallout with Klopp has presented an issue for incoming manager Slot. Liverpool and Feyenoord have agreed a compensation package for the Dutch manager and sorting out Salah\u2019s future will be one of the first jobs on his list at Anfield. \u2019 As ex-Reds defender Jamie Carragher pointed out on X: \u201cMo Salah and Jurgen Klopp are both LFC legends.

Just look at how Kevin De Bruyne shouting at Pep Guardiola to \u201cshut up\u201d was viewed after the Citizens routed Real Madrid 4-0, it was positive. Liverpool star Mo Salah is being tipped to leave Anfield after his touchline row with Jurgen Klopp Mo Salah and Jurgen Klopp were embroiled in their bizarre touchline row at West Ham over a handshake snub it has now been revealed, though speculation the star will quit Liverpool this summer could yet be a bigger factor, it has been claimed. The Reds have seen their hopes of a fairytale finish under Klopp crumble in recent weeks off the back of a dire run of form that has seen their Europa League adventure unexpectedly ended at the quarter-finals stage and their Premier League title hopes implode. With just one win in their last five Premier League matches, Liverpool are now five points behind Arsenal, and four adrift of Man City, with Pep Guardiola\u2019s side now having a game in hand. The push for a \u2018quadruple\u2019 of trophies has quickly come away at the seams this month and the club\u2019s miserable end to the season epitomized by the apparent touchline argument Klopp had with star striker Mohamed Salah during Saturday\u2019s draw. As he was about to enter the pitch as a second-half substitute, television coverage showed Salah and Klopp exchanging words on the sidelines. Klopp had walked over to speak to the forward, which prompted a response from the Egyptian. Salah then continued to speak in Klopp\u2019s direction, raising his arms in apparent frustration, after the German had walked away, before teammate Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was also set to be introduced as a substitute, intervened to end the eyebrow-raising exchange. Speaking after the match, Klopp did not say what the incident was about but told TNT Sports: \u201cWe spoke already in the dressing room. Those emotions spilled over on Saturday lunchtime, when Liverpool played out a frustrating 2-2 draw with West Ham at the London Stadium in a result that pretty much signalled the death knell on their title hopes. Salah was named as a substitute for the game, but, upon his introduction off the bench as a 79th-minute substitute, was seen to get involved in a furious war of words over Klopp. With the Egyptian seen pointing at Klopp and the pitch, the Reds manager was seen to be shouting back at his player, with their feud spilling out beyond full-time with the pair snubbing one another. Now, according to The Sun, the row exploded because Klopp wanted a handshake from Salah before entering the field and although they eventually did a fist bump, the damage was already done. \u201cHe is very big on interaction with his subs before they go on and felt it didn\u2019t happen at first with Mo. \u201cMo was obviously annoyed at being left out of the team and wasn\u2019t in the best of moods while Jurgen wasn\u2019t happy with his behaviour. \u201d The source added: \u201cThe players were given a couple of days off after the match and are meeting up again on Tuesday. \u201cIt is hoped that by then tensions will have calmed down. \u201d Klopp plays down feud, but Salah stokes the flames After the match, Klopp did his best to play down the row, only saying: \u201cWe spoke about it in the dressing room, but it\u2019s done for me.

Jurgen Klopp doesn't tend to fall out with his own players, Mohamed Salah's obviously frustrated because he's not starting the game and there was a few choice words between them. You can't dress it up - he wants to play. The push for a \u2018quadruple\u2019 of trophies has quickly come away at the seams this month and the club\u2019s miserable end to the season epitomized by the apparent touchline argument Klopp had with star striker Mohamed Salah during Saturday\u2019s draw. As he was about to enter the pitch as a second-half substitute, television coverage showed Salah and Klopp exchanging words on the sidelines. Klopp had walked over to speak to the forward, which prompted a response from the Egyptian. Salah then continued to speak in Klopp\u2019s direction, raising his arms in apparent frustration, after the German had walked away, before teammate Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was also set to be introduced as a substitute, intervened to end the eyebrow-raising exchange. Speaking after the match, Klopp did not say what the incident was about but told TNT Sports: \u201cWe spoke already in the dressing room. Mohamed Salah's future has come under increased scrutiny as he appeared to show his discontent in a touchline conflict with Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool drew against West Ham Mohamed Salah has been tipped to leave Liverpool this summer following his touchline spat with Jurgen Klopp against West Ham. The German coach will depart Anfield at the end of the season, but Clinton Morrison believes Salah could follow him out of the door. It is a moment which could signal the end of an era on Merseyside. The Reds' aspirations to end the season in success unravelled against the Irons as they could only draw. The results sees them five points behind Arsenal with three matches remaining of the season, and Man City able to overtake the Gunners via a game in hand. MO Salah's bust-up with Jurgen Klopp exploded over a touchline handshake snub. Liverpool boss Klopp expected a handshake with Salah before he went on as sub in the 2-2 draw at West Ham and, although they eventually did a fist bump, the damage was done. 1 Mo Salah and Jurgen Klopp clashed over a handshake snub Credit: Getty A source said: \"This has happened occasionally with Jurgen and other players. \"He is very big on interaction with his subs before they go on and felt it didn't happen at first with Mo. \"Mo was obviously annoyed at being left out of the team and wasn't in the best of moods while Jurgen wasn't happy with his behaviour. \" Salah snubbed Klopp at the end of the match too as he came off the pitch, shaking hands with Hammers boss David Moyes but ignoring his own manager. Those emotions spilled over on Saturday lunchtime, when Liverpool played out a frustrating 2-2 draw with West Ham at the London Stadium in a result that pretty much signalled the death knell on their title hopes. Salah was named as a substitute for the game, but, upon his introduction off the bench as a 79th-minute substitute, was seen to get involved in a furious war of words over Klopp. With the Egyptian seen pointing at Klopp and the pitch, the Reds manager was seen to be shouting back at his player, with their feud spilling out beyond full-time with the pair snubbing one another. Now, according to The Sun, the row exploded because Klopp wanted a handshake from Salah before entering the field and although they eventually did a fist bump, the damage was already done. Incoming Liverpool manager Arne Slot has made his feelings extremely clear on Mohamed Salah\u2019s future. The Egyptian has already cemented his status as a Liverpool legend during Jurgen Klopp\u2019s tenue at Anfield but his future has been plunged into doubt after a touchline row with his manager against West Ham on Saturday. Salah and Klopp clashed after the forward was dropped to the bench for the game against the Hammers amid a poor spell of form after returning from the Africa Cup of Nations. Advert The 31-year-old has scored just five goals in his last 13 appearances, two of which have been penalties, and his fallout with Klopp has presented an issue for incoming manager Slot. Liverpool and Feyenoord have agreed a compensation package for the Dutch manager and sorting out Salah\u2019s future will be one of the first jobs on his list at Anfield. \u2019 As ex-Reds defender Jamie Carragher pointed out on X: \u201cMo Salah and Jurgen Klopp are both LFC legends. We don't need to take sides! \u201cSalah is frustrated and angry with Jurgen that he's not playing and at that moment didn't want to fully embrace the boss, Jurgen understandably took exception. \u201cMo was daft with his comment in the moved [mixed] zone but let's let them sort it out and enjoy the last few weeks together. \u201cThey've been a massive help to each other in all that's been achieved at the club!\u201d Carragher is correct that these things happen and shouldn\u2019t be given too much weight, nearly always it is the case the result determines how such incidents are interpreted. Just look at how Kevin De Bruyne shouting at Pep Guardiola to \u201cshut up\u201d was viewed after the Citizens routed Real Madrid 4-0, it was positive. The furious moment has left many questioning the relationship between Klopp and Salah with only three games remaining in their season. The Sun claim that the dispute started over Salah deciding against shaking Klopp\u2019s hand before heading onto the pitch. It is not the first time that such an incident has happened involving Klopp, but never this high-profile as the German coach is very keen on interacting with the substitutes before they come on. Watch all the Premier League and Champions League drama unfold on TNT Sports. Clinton Morrison says he would be surprised to see Mohamed Salah stay at Liverpool after his touchline spat with Reds manager Jurgen Klopp. Salah and Klopp had a heated argument during Liverpool\u2019s 2-2 draw at West Ham on Saturday afternoon, with the player waiting to come on as a substitute. Obviously, a lot has been made of the incident. The Liverpool forward was clearly unhappy after the full-time whistle, refusing to be interviewed but telling reporters while walking through the mixed zone: \u201cIf I speak today there will be fire. \u201d The exchange reportedly stemmed from Salah ignoring Klopp\u2019s request for a handshake before coming on the pitch as a substitute. The lesson? Do not leave Jurgen Norbert Klopp hanging. Plenty has been said already with Salah\u2019s long-term future at Anfield in serious doubt. \u201cHe is very big on interaction with his subs before they go on and felt it didn\u2019t happen at first with Mo. \u201cMo was obviously annoyed at being left out of the team and wasn\u2019t in the best of moods while Jurgen wasn\u2019t happy with his behaviour. \u201d The source added: \u201cThe players were given a couple of days off after the match and are meeting up again on Tuesday. \u201cIt is hoped that by then tensions will have calmed down. \u201d Klopp plays down feud, but Salah stokes the flames After the match, Klopp did his best to play down the row, only saying: \u201cWe spoke about it in the dressing room, but it\u2019s done for me. That\u2019s it. \u201d Salah, however, was still clearly seething when he spoke after the game, by responding: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be fire today if I speak..\n\nQuestion: What sparked the feud between Mohamed Salah and Jurgen Klopp during Liverpool's game against this Football Club?\nAnswers:\nA.

But there is certainly a buzz about the former Florida State star, who was selected in the fifth round of the NFL Draft on Saturday. \"This is a freaking dream come true,\" Travis told reporters after being picked. \"I mean, it still hasn't hit me yet. My emotions are kind of everywhere right now. \" Travis was having a Heisman Trophy-worthy season in 2023 before a gruesome leg injury knocked him out for the season early in a 58-13 win over North Alabama on Nov. 18, a victory that improved the Seminoles at the time to 11-0 but called into question whether they were worthy going forward of being in the Top 4 in the College Football Playoff rankings. To have an opportunity to go work with him and just learn from him is such a blessing. \" Travis was known as a dual threat in college, meaning he could beat teams with his arm and his legs. His 97 total touchdowns and 10,553 all-purpose yards are Florida State records. He is not yet cleared to begin football activities, but the anticipation is he should fully recover from his injury. \"I'm a playmaker. That's the main thing,\" Travis said. \"I make plays when everything breaks down. Yeah, man, I'm just a baller. I'm a competitor. Every single time I get on the field, I want to dominate the guy across from me. And I'm a winner. Former LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels was one of the most hyped players in the 2024 NFL Draft class. The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner didn't have to wait long to hear his name called, as he went to the Washington Commanders with the No. 2 overall pick. Daniels blossomed as a passer during his two seasons in Baton Rouge and has dynamic playmaking ability as a runner. The Commanders have been searching for a true franchise quarterback for over two decades and new head coach Dan Quinn may have found his man in Daniels. Get your Jayden Daniels Commanders jersey now at Fanatics. Daniels, a former four-star quarterback recruit, spent the first three seasons of his career at Arizona State. The 6-foot-3, 318-pound Graham dominated last season despite playing with a club on his hand for weeks as he battled through a broken thumb. He made 36 tackles including 7\u00bd for loss and three sacks, three quarterback hurries, one pass breakup, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. He shares the rare blend of production with both the pass rush and run stuffing from the interior of the line. According to Pro Football Focus, he was the No. 4 most valuable defensive tackle in the nation per its wins above average metric, and No. 6 among DTs with a 15. 9% pass rush win rate. Graham is the No. 2 overall prospect, per Pro Football Focus' early big board. Robinson, who arrived to Columba in 2019, was selected by the Arizona Cardinals at pick No. 27. With the draft being held in Robinson's hometown of Detroit, he was able to share the special moment with his family and Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz by his side. Missouri defensive lineman Darius Robinson greets NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and shows off his Eric Seals / USA TODAY NETWORK \"When you coach young men,\" Drinkwitz said Friday, \"you're trying to help them chase a dream and you see the hard stuff, you see the tears, you see the hard work, the heartbreak. For all that to come together at this point, for him to realize his dream, it's such a special thing and its really why I coach football. \" Had your back since Day 1#MIZ \ud83d\udc2f\ud83c\udfc8 pic. twitter. Teams haven\u2019t been exactly banging down the door to sign him as a free agent. Yet Elliott seemingly has some special value to the Cowboys beyond the positive locker room influence that Jones noted during the draft. Maybe Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy dropped a hint when asked about the running back shutout during the draft, maintaining, \"We\u2019re not done yet. \" Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott (21) celebrates a touchdown in the fourth quarter against the Indianapolis Colts at AT&T Stadium. They sure could have used Elliott last season as the most glaring weakness for the NFL\u2019s highest-scoring offense was its struggles punching the ball in when close to the goal line. And in January 2023 the team brought back former star linebacker DeMeco Ryans as head coach. Three months later, the Texans selected Ohio State quarterback C. J. Stroud with the No. 2 pick in the NFL Draft. He promptly won NFL Rookie of the Year honors last season and guided Houston to a division title that led to a resurgence of fan interest that left the Texans ninth again in average home attendance in the NFL. During the offseason the Texans traded for All-Pro wide receiver Stefon Diggs. The demand to buy jerseys from those two stars aligns perfectly with a natural desire for fans to snap up merchandise featuring the new look, and the team was ready at launch with a full line of merchandise reflecting the new brand. There\u2019s one thing for sure: You never know who\u2019s going to be a first-round talent in any draft a year before it happens. After the 2022 season, LSU quarterback Jaydan Daniels was a good prospect who had transferred from a tumultuous Arizona State program and led all FBS quarterbacks in rushing yards, but had just 17 passing touchdowns. A year later, Daniels had a credible argument as the best quarterback in the class, and went second overall to the Washington Commanders after a 40-touchdown season in which he won the Heisman Trophy. So, when we look a year ahead with a first-round mock, there\u2019s obviously a lot of speculation. What we can surmise at this point is that the 2025 draft class will not be as packed with quarterbacks as this most recent class was..\n\nQuestion: Who did this Football team select with the No. 2 pick in the NFL Draft?\nAnswers:\nA.

CHENNAI: Value addition in electronics manufacturing in country needs to double from 18%-20% to 40% and component making should be shifted from China, said electronics and IT secretary S Krishnan on Saturday. India brought the electronics assembly and now it is essential to shift supply-chains from China to move up the value chain and gain global market share, Krishnan asserted, but cautioned the country should take up value addition only where it is possible. He stressed the need for capacity building, training and participation of large industrial groups into the sector. Krishnan said southern states should move out of labour-intensive electronics manufacturing services (EMS) like assembly and packaging and focus more on higher-value component manufacturing. Krishnan said shifting electronics supply chain is crucial for building a resilient supply chain, safeguarding the economy from geopolitical risks and strategic requirements, referring to potential conflict in Taiwan strait. \" The footage included several close-ups on parts of the drone that included the logo of General Atomics, which manufactures the drone, and serial numbers corresponding with known parts made by the company.

S. military has lost at least five drones to the rebels counting Thursday's shootdown \u2014 in 2017, 2019, 2023 and this year. Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The drone shootdown comes as the Houthis launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, demanding Israel ends the war in Gaza, which the Hamas-controlled health ministry says has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians there. \u00c2\u00a9 Provided by Xinhua Military spending by the United States rose 2. 3 percent to reach 916 billion U. S. dollars in 2023, representing 68 percent of total North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military spending, according to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report. WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A recently released report showed that defense spending by the United States -- the world's largest military spender -- accounted for nearly 40 percent of world's total military expenditures in 2023. In the latest move of aggressive U. S. military spending, U. S. President Joe Biden signed a 95-billion-USD foreign aid bill, which includes more military aid for Ukraine and Israel. With its skyrocketing military spending and unabated appetite for global hegemony, the United States continues to fuel chaos around the world. Boeing donated $150,000 to Portland State University to name a classroom and provides about $28,000 a year for scholarships, the school newspaper PSU Vanguard reported. Portland State doesn\u2019t have investments in Boeing. Student protests over the Israel-Hamas war have erupted on college campuses across the country, particularly after last week\u2019s arrest of more than 100 demonstrators at Columbia University in New York. Students have called for universities to separate themselves from companies they say are advancing Israel\u2019s military efforts in Gaza \u2014 and in some cases from Israel itself. About a dozen Portland State students and supporters waved Palestinian flags and held pro-Palestinian signs on Friday. They have a list of 13 demands, including three that involve the university cutting ties with Boeing. Louis County manufacturing line into 2027.

(MainichiMasahiro Kawata) TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan and the European Union will agree to deepen cooperation on economic security, including strengthening supply chain resilience for semiconductors and other critical materials, government sources said Sunday, with the move coming amid efforts to reduce dependency on specific countries such as China. The leaders of Japan and the 27-nation bloc are working toward issuing a joint statement promoting the establishment of transparent, resilient and sustainable supply chains at a Japan-EU High-level Economic Dialogue to be held in Paris in early May, the sources said. Japan has been trying to deepen partnerships with allies and like-minded nations to develop resilient supply chains for critical products in the face of heightened geopolitical and economic security risks, such as Russia's war on Ukraine and China's growing clout. \u201cSo you sell off factories, and it works fine until it didn\u2019t. \u201d GKN, meanwhile, faced its own internal changes. Melrose, a British turnaround firm, took control of the company through an $11 billion hostile takeover in 2018. It set about breaking up the old British manufacturing conglomerate, completing the separation of GKN Aerospace from GKN\u2019s automotive unit last year. Melrose planned to shut down some U. S. factories and consolidate operations in Texas. GKN and Melrose said in court filings that business at its Hazelwood plant was \u201cunsustainable\u201d and \u201cthe unforeseen loss of two major programs with non-Boeing related customers\u201d also impacted the factory\u2019s viability. Boeing is being forced to take some essential manufacturing functions back in house in part because aerospace suppliers are in a tough business themselves, Aboulafia said. \"When our delegation hit the ground, our companies already had access and exposure to the right people to quickly get deals done,\" said Caroline Chapdelaine, CEO of Northstar Photonics.

S. 's efforts to keep its largest telecommunication company, Huawei, at bay with economic levers and tariffs, according to Chapdelaine. Meanwhile, \"The U.

Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich (2014 semifinals) After winning two Champions Leagues with Barcelona, Pep Guardiola found himself up against familiar foes in his first season at Bayern. With the Bundesliga already sewn up in quick time, Die Roten headed to the Bernabeu confident of retaining their European crown. Karim Benzema scoring the only goal of the first leg wasn't a disaster in footballing terms. What followed certainly was. \"I got it wrong, man. I got it totally wrong. This is his best chance to win a trophy in a long time, and he has a tremendous opportunity to do so in style: by winning the Champions League. Kane is a natural finisher and will have no problem picking up space in the heart of the Madrid defense. He scored 11 goals in his last 10 matches and averaged 2. 1 shots on target during that time, cashing the over in six of the 10 matches. Bayern is going to need him to have a great game against a Madrid team that has the best defense in Spain and was solid in the UCL. Real Madrid props: Over 5. 5 corners (+186 or better) Bayern is the home team in the first leg, and historically, that means Madrid is more likely to play on the counter-attack. The former Tottenham defender's presence for a game of this magnitude looked like a potential weak spot for Madrid's lethal attack to prey upon, but it was his centre-back partner Kim Min-jae who erred. The South Korea international darted out of the defensive line haphazardly to allow Vinicius in for the opening goal and he repeated the error before Manuel Neuer saved from the Brazil international in the 79th minute. Two minutes later, Kim clumsily brought down Rodrygo and Vinicius converted from 12 yards for his 21st goal of the season. With a return date at the Santiago Bernabeu eight days from now, it feels like advantage to the 14-time champions.

Kroos takes aim and that's a fine save from Neuer, especially as it looked like there was a slight deflection involved. Kickoff: 2nd Half We're back underway and there's a change for Bayern, with Guerreiro on for Goretzka. Halftime Kane heads clear at the near post and that's a warp on the first half. Madrid had to ride out a bit of an early storm but then Vinicius Jr. gave them the lead and it's been relatively plain sailing from that point. 45th minute: Only a three-man wall, which makes Rodrygo's eyes light up.

The BWF Web site on Thursday declared Taiwan the team to watch in the Thomas Cup, saying that they had a well-rounded lineup led by Chou and backed up by Wang Tzu-wei and Lin Chun-yi in singles, with choice players in doubles.

Villa Park seems to be a special hunting ground for Mauricio Pochettino and his Chelsea players because they won earlier on in the year in the FA Cup. Following a controversial VAR call, which disallowed a stoppage-time winner for the away team, it could have been another valuable win for the struggling Premier League club. Instead, the London club had to rue on the fact that they conceded another early goal, after their 5-0 thumping at Arsenal, and were 2-0 down at the break. But Chelsea came out fighting during the second half and deservedly walked away with a point. There were many positives to take from the game and performances to be proud of for Pochettino.

C. on Saturday. The 72-year-old Wonder Woman star posed up a storm in her elegant halter navy dress as it clung to her frame and had dazzling details on the front. She also added a black fuzzy shrug that draped down towards her elbows for a fashionable flare. She threw her dark locks into an up-do as she accessorized with navy toned diamond earrings and a matching bracelet for the high profile event. The dinner helps 'support journalists working to cover the president, events and programs to educate the public about the value of the First Amendment and a free press, and scholarships to help the next generation of journalists,' per the website. Her evolution to her current status as Empress of Style has been informed by stints in advertising, (she worked in film production company), modelling and Bollywood (a couple of walk on parts in mainstream cinema) followed by spells as fashion director at a slew of international fashion magazines like Elle L\u2019Officiel and Vogue that had set up shop in Mumbai. Along with a handful of influential and visionary editors of those titles she is responsible for guiding Indian fashion and styling to its current look, though mercifully her approach has been refreshingly free of Western big brand influences, distinguished by a timeless and contextual relevance. It is this unique sensibility that sets her apart. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the mix so\u201d she says \u201cif you see my work, it\u2019s always mixed.

The 66-year-old performer flashed a smile as she posed for a few snaps on the red carpet of the annual star-studded event. The National President of SAG\u2013AFTRA opted for a patterned white jacket that was paired with a matching pair of pants. Drescher also wore a pair of sparkling silver high-heeled shoes and carried a matching purse. The star of The Nanny accessorized with a single necklace and a sparkling pair of earrings, both of which gave her look for the evening a bit of extra shine. Fran Drescher made quite the impression while arriving at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, which was held in Washington, D. C. Her talent as an actress gets her the meaty on-screen roles, and afterward, her appearance and style make her one of the most consistently striking figures on the red carpet. Unlike some stars, who will just throw on the gown their stylist or allied fashion brand gives them and be done with it, Zendaya and Roach seem to thoughtfully plan each press tour. The Spider-Man era saw Zendaya wearing a sparkly webbed dress one night, a Dr. Octopus-like Roberto Cavalli gown on another, and a green and purple Valentino ensemble on the Graham Norton Show. For Dune: Part Two, she went high-fashion with cut-out dresses and 3D gold pieces and forward-thinking shapes. And for Challengers, she embraced a little more levity with bright colors and playful cuts. To Zuckerman, the mixture of new, forward-thinking looks with archival pieces is what\u2019s really fascinating.

As the credits roll, one can\u2019t help but feel a pang of disappointment over what could have been had the filmmakers dared to think just a tad bit more outside the coffin. Unless you\u2019re a glutton for punishment, you might want to sink your teeth into something more satisfying. Abigail is currently running in theatres. As with the works of fellow BookTok sensation Colleen Hoover, A Court of Thorns and Roses\u2019 popularity drove not just book sales, but conversations. Around this book and others like it, a new term crystallised: romantasy. Romantasy is currently experiencing extraordinary visibility both on digital platforms and in local bookstores. The marriage of romance and fantasy To be clear: romance and fantasy are not new bedfellows \u2013 they have had a long and healthy relationship. The two genres have been in conversation since Guinevere first saw Lancelot. Many authors have made successful careers by exploring romantic tropes in fantasy fiction, or fantastical elements in romance fiction. In the 1970s, Anne Rice famously did the former with her Vampire Chronicles , starting with Interview with the Vampire , adapted into a film in 1994 and a TV series in 2022. April 28, 2024 01:20 pm | Updated 01:20 pm IST From the creatives behind the recent Scream sequels and Ready or Not comes a B-movie masquerading as yet another genre-defying revelation. Abigail serves up a bloody concoction of tired vampire tropes and half-baked humour that leaves us thirsting for something, anything, with a bit more bite. The premise of this undead debacle starts off with some promise \u2014 a ragtag crew of criminals embark on a daring kidnapping mission, only to realize they\u2019ve bitten off more than they can chew. From the outset, it\u2019s clear that Abigail suffers from an identity crisis of epic proportions. Is it a modern spin on Dracula\u2019s Daughter? Is it a heist flick? A creature feature? Or perhaps just another misguided attempt from Universal at relevance in the oversaturation of its very own Monsterverse. In 2015, Sarah J Maas published A Court of Thorns and Roses , in which teen heroine Feyre is swept away from her human life into a world of magical fairy court intrigue and romance. The novel, which was marketed as a young adult, was very popular. It hit, among others, the New York Times bestseller list. However, the short-term success of the book pales in comparison to the longer-term success of the (five-book) series it belongs to. Maas has now sold 40 million copies of her books worldwide (as of February 2024). A Court of Thorns and Roses (referred to by fans as ACOTAR) was already popular on bookish social media, but it hit truly extraordinary heights with the emergence of BookTok \u2013 the reader-generated, bookish arm of the social media platform TikTok. As Christian Slater hinted in the recent interview, the setup was ideal for a follow-up. Yet, despite the ripe storytelling potential, a direct continuation wasn't in the cards. Could a sequel with Cruise still happen? As the interviewers and Slater point out, Tom Cruise barely looks like he's aged since the last time he put on the Vampire Lestat's fangs. So, never say never. That said, even though I like every Panda movie, I will say that they\u2019re not all equally good. So, which one movie is the absolute best? Well, you\u2019re about to find out! Skadoosh. (Image credit: DreamWorks Animation) 4. Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024) The most recent film in the franchise, Kung Fu Panda 4 is in an interesting spot, in that we probably didn\u2019t need another sequel. In our review of the movie , our very own Eric Eisenberg called it the \u201cweakest entry\u201d in the series, and I wholeheartedly agree. In it, Master Shifu, for some reason, is under the impression that Po needs to choose a successor, even though he still seems to be doing pretty fine as the Dragon Warrior. He can\u2019t say anything during these action sequences. As the architect behind these fight scenes, how did you incorporate emotions \u2014 humor, fear, and love \u2014 in the choreography for Bill [Skarsg\u00e5rd]? With Bill, for example, he\u2019s a great character actor. He knows how to express himself through his eyes. He knows how to express himself through the movements. There\u2019s something very special about Boy. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s just a skilled martial artist, but there\u2019s some goofiness to him. Something that makes him very lovely. You sympathize very quickly with him. I think the humor level inside of fighting is if you don\u2019t have limitations to the violence, you can do whatever you want. That\u2019s why I took the cheese grater, for example. I remember having this Zoom call with Moritz. One of Disney's most profitable movies has never had a sequel (Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC. [+] Images) GC Images Few movie studios are as famous for making sequels as Disney. There are 33 movies in its Marvel Cinematic Universe, it has made three big screen sequels to Star Wars and Frozen will return for a third time in 2026. If a movie makes more than a billion Dollars at the box office it's unlikely Disney will let it go. With one notable exception. Only one of Disney's entries in the 30 highest-grossing films of all time is not a sequel or doesn't have a sequel. Remarkably, analysis of more than a thousand pages of company filings has revealed that it is one of the most profitable movies in the studio's 100-year history. Of the film\u2019s many egregious missteps, its handling of the titular character, Abigail, would have Tchaikovsky rolling in his grave. While Alisha Weir admirably sinks her teeth into her role as a ballerina vampire, the character itself is more grating than engaging, veering dangerously close to caricature territory. Unfortunately, the character\u2019s sarcastic quips and penchant for psychological mind games feel more toothless than terrifying, leaving us longing for the days when vampires were more Bram Stoker and less. pirouetting to Swan Lake. Abigail (English) Director: Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett Cast: Alisha Weir, Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Will Catlett, Kevin Durand, Angus Cloud, and Giancarlo Esposito Runtime: 109 minutes Storyline: A group of would-be criminals kidnap a little girl who is actually a bloodthirsty vampire. The supporting cast fares a little better, with performances that range from wooden to downright cringe-worthy. I think the tomahawks were Moritz\u2019s idea, by the way. But that was the approach, figuring out the shape first and then going into my \u201cmartial arts soup. \u201d Also with the camera style, deciding what is great, what is not great, and then using that at the end of the day. *June27 is a character played by Jessica Rothe. Whose idea was it to put the helmet on her [June27]? That was a badass move. I liked all the phrases coming across her helmet. Yeah, that\u2019s Moritz. I don\u2019t know what was the inspiration behind it, but it\u2019s very unique. I love it. I have a helmet myself at home, which Moritz is a bit jealous of.

The Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 backs are against the wall. Since starting off their first-round series against the New York Knicks over a week ago, the Sixers haven\u2019t found much success. On the road at Madison Square Garden, the Sixers were defeated convincingly in Game 1. While a Game 2 victory was in their grasp, the Sixers coughed up a multi-possession lead late in the fourth quarter, allowing the Knicks to send the Sixers back to Philly down two games. A major Game 3 performance by Joel Embiid helped the Sixers put together the most lopsided matchup in the series so far. That time, it was in the Sixers\u2019 favor. While Philadelphia looked forward to potentially having a repeat performance in Game 4 on Sunday, the Sixers came up short on their home court, which felt like a home game for the Knicks in the end. April 30, 2024 03:30 pm | Updated 03:50 pm IST - NEW DELHI Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 30 wrote personal letters to all NDA candidates in the fray in the third phase of Lok Sabha polls to take on what he termed Congress\u2019s \u201cdivisive agenda\u201d including that of giving reservations to Muslims by snatching it SC/ST and OBCs as well as \u201cdangerous ideas\u201d like bringing in inheritance tax. Stressing that the current polls were \u201cno ordinary election\u201d he said: \u201cThey (Opposition) are also bent upon taking away the hard-earned wealth of the people and giving it to their vote bank. The Congress has also made it clear that they will bring in dangerous ideas like inheritance tax. The nation must unite to stop them.

But there are opportunities that have just not been presented to her and I know that there are so many of these young brands that somehow need more finance, somehow need more support, help with the infrastructure, which the big brands obviously have crazy infrastructure. Which when you do get, you know, they are at risk of just having to sell a chunk of it to somebody in order to stay alive.

In spite of its setbacks, including damning reviews of the only model it has managed to bring to production, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) probe, and reports of thousands of canceled orders, Fisker seemingly remains fairly attractive to investors. Nissan briefly considered buying the carmaker earlier in 2024 but the talks ended without a deal, according to an earlier report. Deutsche Bank is helping Fisker look for takeover candidates, and the company has already turned down one offer that wasn't \"sufficient,\" its CEO said. Fisker hasn't commented on the report. However, according to Aubrey, there were strings attached behind the scenes. Aubrey O\u2019Day claimed Diddy included as part of the deal that artists needed to sign NDAs. This maneuver was designed to silence them from speaking out on their experiences while at Bad Boy, and most certainly in the presence of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs. Aubrey shut that right on down. She feels her ability to talk about her time during her Bad Boy days is more valuable than what was being offered. Not to mention, her talking now has been consistent with her energy for years. O\u2019Day has been talking about Diddy\u2019s behavior for a long time, and she has been sounding the alarm. Podcast CAPITOL WEEKLY PODCAST: Last month, as California prepared to roll out a new $20 minimum wage for fast food workers, attention on an exemption for restaurants that bake their own bread surprised many, including both the bill\u2019s author, Asm. Chris Holden, and Gov. Newsom. \u201cPaneragate\u201d (named for the restaurant chain that some claimed would benefit from the exemption \u2013 note that both the governor and the franchisee dispute that the exemption applies) spotlighted a little-known tool in the legislative toolbox: the use of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) in crafting public policy. While NDAs are commonplace in the business world, their use in policy work was a surprise to many, even some elected officials. In March, Republican Assemblyman Vince Fong introduced AB 2654, which would ban lawmakers from entering into confidentiality agreements related to proposed legislation. \u201d. But is the use of NDAs as sinister as critics make out? Our guest today, former Speaker Robert Hertzberg argues that confidentiality agreements are a key part of building trust in sensitive legislative negotiations between diametrically opposed parties \u2013 and are sometimes the only way to get warring sides to the table.

After all, if the coffee you're using is not of good quality, it won't turn out as well. By this, we don't mean you need to buy expensive coffee but ensure that it is fresh and has high-quality content. This way, your cold coffee will have a rich flavour and won't taste bland. 2. Adding too much milk Do you end up adding too much milk to your cold coffee? If so, it's time to stop. While you may prefer your cold coffee with more milk, this can reduce the coffee flavour. A good cold coffee maintains a well-balanced proportion of coffee and milk. If you like your cold coffee creamy, consider using full-fat milk. 3. \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t just run on Dunkin\u2019, cars do too. \u201d Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and police said there were no signs the driver was impaired..\n\nQuestion: What is the reason behind this Comedian's \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" show?\nAnswers:\nA.

It's a dream come true, but the work has just started for the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner. It won't be easy, as every rookie quarterback has gone through struggles. However, Williams is confident that as long as he's himself, he will be just fine. The 22-year-old told reporters in Chicago, including Dan Wiederer of The Chicago Tribune. \"I don't think about it, to be honest with you,\" Williams said. \"I think about just doing my job, handling the things I can handle, dealing with the small things, holding everybody accountable and everybody holding me accountable. Why Spencer Rattler is unfazed after dropping to Saints in fifth round of 2024 NFL Draft COLUMBIA \u2014 The focus for many regarding former South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler in the 2024 NFL draft was the lingering question of why he was a fifth-round pick. There were debates about his character after projections and mock drafts that once had Rattler going as early as the first round, turned out to be incorrect. Rattler eventually was selected No. 150 overall by the New Orleans Saints. Even with a quarterback-filled first round, and two days of sitting on the couch with no phone call from an NFL team, Rattler said in an interview with the Saints, that none of that really mattered. \"At the end of the day, its a blessing to get picked wherever,\" Rattler said Sunday. Outside of the top six quarterbacks, all of whom were selected in the first 12 picks of the 2024 NFL Draft, South Carolina's Spencer Rattler was widely viewed as the next best prospect. Many experts had Rattler projected as a second- or third-round pick heading into the weekend, but he fell to the Saints at pick No. 150 in the fifth round. ESPN's Adam Schefter detailed what he sees as the biggest reason for Rattler's fall Monday. \"You know what I think it was with Spencer Rattler more than anything else? The two teams that liked him most, based on the people I spoke to, were the Denver Broncos and the Atlanta Falcons,\" Schefter said on \"The Pat McAfee Show. \" \"I think they had a mid-second, early third-round grade on him.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Former Republican Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder will be arraigned from federal prison on the 10 new felony counts recently brought against him by the state, as revelations mount surrounding the scandal that landed him there. Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Brendan Sheehan this week agreed to allow Householder to appear at the May 13 proceeding by video stream from Elkton Federal Correctional Institution south of Youngstown, where he is serving 20 years for his role in the largest corruption case in state history. The permission follows postponement of an earlier arraignment on the state\u2019s charges where Householder was to appear in person. A jury convicted Householder, 64, on a federal racketeering charge in June for his role orchestrating a $60 million bribery scheme funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. Said the poll analysis, \u201cJohnson is viewed favorably by 52% of Republicans and 40% of both Democrats and voters not affiliated with either major party. \u201d Because he pushed through a foreign aid bill that included billions of dollars for Ukraine, some conservatives led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) are trying to oust him. But that effort is in trouble of being pushed back by Democrats. Ron Bonjean, a former spokesman for a former Republican House speaker and Republican Senate majority leader, noted the unusualness of Johnson\u2019s good polls, especially when the public is down on President Joe Biden. \u201cA Republican speaker has this type of growing popularity, which is even stronger than Biden\u2019s favorability, is rather unheard of in today\u2019s fractured society,\u201d Bonjean, a co-founder of Washington\u2019s ROKK Solutions, a bipartisan communications firm, said. Householder was one of five people arrested in July 2020 and charged in the scheme. All were accused of using the $60 million in secretly funded FirstEnergy cash to get Householder\u2019s chosen Republican candidates elected to the House in 2018 and then to help him get elected speaker in January 2019. The money was then used to win passage of the tainted energy bill and to conduct a dirty-tricks campaign to prevent a repeal referendum from reaching the ballot. Lobbyist and former Ohio Republican Party chairman Matt Borges was convicted alongside Householder last summer and sentenced to five years. He also has appealed. Lobbyist Juan Cespedes and Jeffrey Longstreth, a top Householder political strategist, pleaded guilty in October 2020 and cooperated with the the government in its prosecution. He has appealed that conviction, arguing that federal prosecutors overstepped the limits of their authority. His lawyers contend that the $60 million, while undisclosed, amounted to legal campaign contributions permitted under federal law. \u201cUnlike most other bribery prosecutions, Householder did not receive an envelope of cash or extravagant gifts or trips. Rather, the government presented evidence that Householder helped raised money into a 501(c)(4) organization, Generation Now,\u201d his lawyers wrote in February, contending \u201cthere is nothing criminal about that. \u201d It turns out the dark money payments flowing from FirstEnergy to benefit powerful Ohio politicians as it was pushing for the nuclear bailout didn\u2019t stop with those raised as part of the Householder prosecution. Recently released records tied to the scandal have revealed that the utility gave $2. 5 million to State Solutions, a 501(c)4 benefiting Ohio Gov. \u201cWe demand that Fox immediately retract and correct today\u2019s statement, which is the latest example of its relentless attack on Hunter Biden in complete disregard for the truth,\u201d the statement said. The original statement from Fox called Hunter Biden \u201cthe subject of investigations by both the Department of Justice and Congress,\u201d adding that he had been indicted \u201cby two different US Attorney\u2019s Offices in California and Delaware. \u201d Fox News Quietly Deletes Hunter Biden \u2018Mock Trial\u2019 Series Hunter Biden has been a central figure in the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry, despite that inquiry being, by definition, aimed at his father, President Joe Biden.

Attorney\u2019s Office in that state..\n\nQuestion: What is the reason for Republicans trying to oust this politician?\nAnswers:\nA. Foreign aid bill\nB. Growing popularity\nC. Fractured society\nD.
