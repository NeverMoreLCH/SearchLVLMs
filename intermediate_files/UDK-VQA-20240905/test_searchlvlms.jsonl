After being critical of the United States Soccer Federation in the past, Canadian national team head coach Jesse Marsch is looking forward to Mauricio Pochettino potentially leading the U. S. men's national team. Marsch was hired by the Canadian national team this year, leading them to a fourth-place finish at Copa America. Having faced off against Mauricio Pochettino in the past, the American holds him in high regard as the American federation reportedly closes in on the Argentine boss. \"I think Pochettino is a good coach.

However, Sweden, after losing to Azerbaijan, bounced back with a convincing 5-0 revenge victory, demonstrating their ability to quickly adjust and regain competitiveness when facing adversity. Furthermore, Azerbaijan has shown stability in defense, with their few defeats mainly attributed to insufficient attacking firepower. On the other hand, although Sweden's attacking prowess has declined, they have displayed relatively solid defensive performances, especially with strong midfield interception abilities, which may limit Azerbaijan's rapid breakthroughs. In terms of individual player comparisons, Sweden's young forward duo, Isak and Kulusevski, undoubtedly pose a threat to Azerbaijan, who need to remain vigilant throughout. Struggling under the shadow of the UEFA Nations League in the past, Sweden's determination will likely burn like a fierce fire as they return to the field. Their painful defeat to Azerbaijan in their previous encounter may fuel their desire for a historical victory on the away grounds. This game resembles a suspense drama, with Azerbaijan playing the role of an upstart character, full of surprises, while Sweden is the old-school tough guy burdened with the mission of revival. Can Azerbaijan deliver a stunning blow against Sweden? Will Sweden seize the opportunity to seek revenge and restore their past glory? Let's wait and see, as this will be a thrilling collision in the European football arena.

World Athletics last year banned transgender women from competing in the female category at international events if they transitioned after puberty. But its para counterpart, World Para Athletics, has not followed suit.

One of my colleagues is leading that. They say that the First Amendment is aggressively individualistic, which is sort of the point. But no, we need more protection through Congress. And this should be the issue of this election. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson defeated John Adams in the only presidential election where free speech was the central issue. Free speech is on the ballot, not democracy. Free speech is on the ballot because, quite frankly, a Harris-Walz administration would be a perfect nightmare for free speech. The Brazilian Supreme Court upheld a ban on X Monday after a court-imposed deadline expired for the company to identify a legal representative in Brazil.

ELON MUSK, RFK CLAIM KAMALA HARRIS WANTS TO SHUT DOWN X UNLESS SITE CONFORMS TO GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT While Brazil's free speech battle rages on, concerns of a similar reality are mounting in the U. S, particularly in light of the Biden-Harris administration's alleged connections with censorship efforts. Prior to becoming vice president, Kamala Harris told CNN she believed former President Trump has \u2018lost his privileges\u2019 to use Twitter, supporting his ban on the social media platform. \"We're talking about a private corporation, Twitter, that has terms of use. And as far as I'm concerned, and I think most people would say, including members of Congress who he has threatened, that he has lost his privileges and it should be taken down. There has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand their power,\" Harris said. Sithole, 37, who lost his legs in a train accident at age 12, won the U. S. Open singles in 2013 and the Australian Open doubles three years later. \u201cIt is our first big medal playing together and we\u2019re very happy to write history,\" Sithole said. \"I was so happy to play with Donald today.

Petrillo grew up in the southern Italian city of Naples. She thought her running aspirations were over when she was diagnosed with Stargardt disease at 14. With Leicester arguing that their successful appeal was based on \u00e2\u0080\u009cflaws\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the Premier League rules, Manchester City may be encouraged by this outcome, but it is uncertain how relevant this very different case is to theirs. City obviously cannot rely on what may appear to be something of a technicality over the date of relegation. Nor is their case about a PSR overspend. However, this was still a significant defeat for the Premier League and City's illustrious legal team will certainly scrutinise the wording of the rules to see if they are being correctly applied.

This past spring, Judge Scott McAfee allowed Trump and his co-defendants to turn his Georgia election fraud case into a circus by letting the defendants put prosecutor Fani Willis on trial\u2014preposterously for having an affair with a fellow prosecutor. While the judge rightly rejected the move to knock Willis out of the case, Trump was not only allowed an early appeal, but a Georgia appeals court suspended proceedings in front of McAfee while it considers Trump's claims. The case will thus be in limbo until after the election. That case joins similar embarrassments to the judiciary this year. Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed Trump's secret document case in Florida, not on its merits, but because of the mechanism used to appoint the prosecutor.

But the announcement expected from Attorney General Merrick Garland is expected to show the depth of U. S. concerns and signal legal actions against those suspected of being involved. The people who discussed the announcement spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because the matter was not public. One of the people said the announcement will involve, in part, an accusation of the use of Russia-state media to spread disinformation and propaganda. Garland and other law enforcement leaders are expected to speak briefly at the opening of a meeting of the Justice Department\u2019s elections threats task force. In a speech last month, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Russia was the primary threat to the election. \" \"What we're seeing nationally is that the numbers of fatalities is declining, but just a bit. We're still at levels that would have been obscene a decade ago,\" Slatky said, \"so it's good that the numbers aren't increasing more, but that's really the only bit of good news. The bad news, when it comes to road safety, is much greater. \". U. S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled that Trump had not satisfied the burden of proof required for a federal court to take control of the case from the state court where it was tried. Hellerstein\u2019s ruling came hours after Manhattan prosecutors raised objections to Trump\u2019s effort to delay post-trial decisions in the case while he sought to have the federal court step in. In a letter to the judge presiding over the case in state court, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office argued that he had no legal obligation to hold off on post-trial decisions and wait for Hellerstein to rule.

Though they differ in many ways, payroll services function similarly during the actual pay run. When you launch a payroll, they show you a list of employees (and possibly contractors; you may run them separately) and their pay rates. You first check to make sure the pay period and pay date are correct. After that, you simply enter the number of hours worked, where applicable, in the appropriate pay type boxes (regular, overtime, vacation, and so on) or import them. Every service has a way to import hours from timesheets or a time clock, which is more likely to be accurate than if you enter them manually. 26 - Sept. 8, 2024 Aug. 26 - Sept. 8, 2024 Location: USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center -- Queens, New York USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center -- Queens, New York TV: ESPN, ABC, Tennis Channel | Stream: fubo (try for free) Men's quarterfinal results Women's quarterfinal results. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates\u2019 names, particularly in swing states,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this.

That photo of people wearing \u2018Nebraska Walz\u2019s for Trump\u2019 shirts? They\u2019re distant cousins A sister of Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz says she doesn\u2019t recognize the people wearing \u201cNebraska Walz\u2019s for Trump\u201d T-shirts in a photo that is making the rounds on social media. It turns out they are distant cousins. The photo shows eight smiling people wearing navy pro-Trump shirts, underneath a \u201cTrump 2024 \u2014 Take America Back\u201d sign. During the unofficial summer season, between Memorial Day and Labor Day, Long Island-based New York State Police troopers responded to 2,180 crashes in Nassau and Suffolk, including 536 involving injuries and five resulting in fatalities. The numbers appear fairly consistent with crash data from recent years, state police said Wednesday. According to records, troopers responded to 2,200 crashes during the same time period last summer and responded to 2,184 crashes during the same time period in 2022. Of those crashes, six involved fatalities in 2023, while five involved fatalities in 2022. State police also said Wednesday that 409 intoxicated and impaired drivers were arrested on state-patrolled Long Island roadways during the 2024 summer season. A message on the state police website with the latest crash data Wednesday warned that summer may be coming to an end, but \"our message will not change. The opening arguments in the closely fought battle for the House are heavy on the cost of living, abortion and the U. S. -Mexico border, with those issues dominating the TV airwaves \u2014 and Trump and Harris going largely unmentioned \u2014 as those down-ballot campaigns heat up. A number of campaigns and outside groups launched new TV ads yesterday in the country\u2019s most competitive House districts, kicking off the two-month sprint to Election Day. While the presidential campaign has been raging for months, fueled by tsunamis of online donations on both sides, many House campaigns save their resources for the final stretch before unloading their money on the issues that they most want to highlight. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is scheduled to appear outside Phoenix Wednesday at a rally with the conservative youth organizing group Turning Point USA, which has been instrumental in remaking the Arizona GOP as a faithful organ of former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America great again\u201d movement. Jimmy McCain\u2019s endorsement and Vance\u2019s Turning Point USA appearance reflect the disparate segments of the GOP that Harris and Trump are trying to reach. Democrats are appealing to traditional conservatives disillusioned by Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP, while Republicans are looking to shore up their base and ensure that their young supporters turn out. Jimmy McCain said he had been an independent since leaving the Republican Party after Trump became its standard bearer in 2016. If you offer additional payroll types like paid time off and sick pay, you can define your policies for accruing these benefits. The services then keep track of them for you. Bonuses and commissions can also be paid during a regular pay run, or you can issue them by creating an off-cycle payroll. Need to include garnishments like child support on paychecks? Payroll services can do that, too. Most also offer custom pay types, so you can create your own, sometimes even when you're in the middle of a pay run. Once you complete the setup, you generally can't return to the dedicated setup tools, so it's essential to get it right the first time. That said, every payroll service we tested has a comprehensive settings section where you can modify and add to the payroll information you've already entered..\n\nQuestion: How many traffic stops were made by Troopers and this Law enforcement division officers in 2024?\nAnswers:\nA. 24,000\nB. 13,000\nC. 16,000\nD. 14,000\nE.

Deepthi Jeevanji with her parents, Yadagiri and Dhanalaxmi, and sister HYDERABAD: Before winning the 400M bronze in the T20 category of the Paris Paralympics on Tuesday, Deepthi Jeevanji had stunned everyone by setting the 400M world record (55. 07 seconds) in the para World championships in Kobe, Japan in May. But it is what she did in between the two global sports meets that has established her status as a true champion. Deepthi recently bought back half of the one-acre plot in Kalleda village in Warangal, her home, that her daily-wager parents had sold eight years ago to support her. The plot was the only possession of value the family had. Gifting the plot back was her way of thanking her parents for not giving up on her. All her life Deepthi had been called a \u00e2\u0080\u0098monkey' and \u00e2\u0080\u0098picchi' (mentally deranged) by villagers. World champion Sachin Sarjerao Khilari clinched a silver in men's shot put F46 event with an Asian record distance of 16. 32m as the country's track-and-field athletes continued their unprecedented medal-winning run in the Paralympic Games here on Wednesday. The 34-year-old Khilari achieved his best throw of the day in his second attempt to better his own Asian record of 16. 30m which he set while winning gold in the World Para-Athletics Championships in Japan in May. However, the effort, which was also his personal best, was not enough for the top honour as Greg Stewart of Canada defended his Tokyo Paralympics gold with a throw of 16. 38m. Luka Bakovic of Croatia took the bronze with 16. 27m. Khilari's silver is the 11th medal from para-athletics in the ongoing Games and took India's overall tally to 21, including three gold. Ndiema was also burned and was being treated at the same hospital. Menach said Ndiema was still in the intensive care unit with burns over 30% of his body but was \u201cimproving and stable. \u201d Cheptegei\u2019s parents said their daughter bought land in Trans Nzoia to be near the county\u2019s many athletic training centers. A report filed by the local chief said the two were heard fighting over the land where her house was built before the attack. The Uganda Athletics Federation eulogized Cheptegei on the social platform X, writing, \u201cWe are deeply saddened to announce the passing of our athlete, Rebecca Cheptegei, early this morning who tragically fell victim to domestic violence. As a federation, we condemn such acts and call for justice. May her soul rest In Peace. Despite all these setbacks, he took up javelin while he was studying to become an engineer. A shoulder injury during competition forced him to switch to shot put. Khilari was introduced to para sports in 2015 and later met well-known coach Satayanarayana who supported him in improving his game. He also worked as a visiting faculty member at various institutions, assisting students in their UPSC and Maharashtra Public Service examination preparations. The previous best show by India's track and field contingent in a single Paralympics was in Tokyo when it won one gold, five silver and two bronze medals. With 11 medals, including a gold from star javelin thrower Sumit Antil, the para athletes have bagged more than half of the country's total medals. World Athletics last year banned transgender women from competing in the female category at international events if they transitioned after puberty. But its para counterpart, World Para Athletics, has not followed suit. Petrillo, who was diagnosed as a teenager with Stargardt disease, a degenerative eye condition, considers herself lucky despite the challenges she\u2019s faced. She\u2019s lived most of her life as a man and only came out as transgender to her wife \u2014 with whom she has a son \u2014 in 2017 before beginning hormone therapy two years later. \u201cYes, I have problems with my vision, I\u2019m partially sighted, I\u2019m trans \u2013 and let\u2019s say that's not the best in our Italy, being trans \u2013 but I am a happy person,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview at a track she trains on in a suburb of Bologna, where she lives. Sport continued to be part of her life \u2013 she played five-a-side soccer for visually impaired athletes \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t until the age of 41 that Petrillo returned to the track, winning 11 national competitions in the male T12 category between 2015 and 2018. She ran her first race as a female in 2020 and went on to finish fifth in the European Para Athletics Championships. She won bronze in the 200 and 400 meters at last year\u2019s World Para Athletics Championships. At the Paralympics, the finals of the women\u2019s T12 400m and 200m will take place on Sept. 3 and 7 respectively, with the heats the previous day. Petrillo will be cheered on by her ex-wife and 9-year-old son as well as her brother. \u201d Petrillo referred to a study funded by the IOC \u2014 and published in April in the British Journal of Sports Medicine \u2014 showing that transgender women were actually at a physical disadvantage compared to cisgender women across several areas, including lung function and lower body strength. \u201cThis means rather that I have a disadvantage, because apart from anything else, going through hormonal treatment means I am going against my body so against the biology of my body and that\u2019s certainly something that\u2019s not good for it,\u201d she said. Petrillo grew up in the southern Italian city of Naples. She thought her running aspirations were over when she was diagnosed with Stargardt disease at 14. Rio 2016: Gold. Tokyo 2020: Silver. Paris 2024: Bronze. The list of achievements is akin to some of the super athletes in the Olympics arena, but it belongs to one Mariyappan Thangavelu, India\u2019s self-effacing para athlete high jumper who often flies under the radar. At 29 years and a slight frame, Mariyappan looks even younger and tends to get overshadowed by the so-called bigger names like the double gold medallist Sumit Antil or former great Devendra Jhajharia, but has shown remarkable consistency in a journey spanning more than eight years now. He had won gold at Rio with a jump of 1. 89m in T63 class, a silver at Tokyo with 1. 86m while late on Tuesday, an effort of 1. 85m yielded him the bronze in Paris to make him the first Indian para-athlete to land medals in three back-to-back Games. \u201d If he\u2019s to notch up another medal in Paris this weekend, Davies will also have to overcome considerable injury problems.

However, both their landlord and psychologists who interviewed the kids claimed it was a hoax, with the former claiming the hauntings started when Ammons fell \u201cbehind on lease and used the claimed paranormal activities to avoid payments\u201d, while the latter reported, \u201cthe children were acting deceptively and in accordance with their mother\u2019s beliefs\u201d. None of the future tenants reported any paranormal activity, and in 2016 the house was demolished. Another bone-chilling horror film titled The Deliverance is out on Netflix, and viewers almost missed the chance to watch Andra Day play the role of Ebony Jackson if the director hadn't helped the actress overcome her fear and doubts. Yes, you read it right. The Deliverance director Lee Daniels played a crucial role in helping Andra Day not to turn down the leading role. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Day explained that she's a Christian and believed that the demonic themes in the film might conflict with her values. She was initially doubtful of the role, but thanks to Lee Daniels, whose creative mind and exceptional representation of Black women boosted Andra Day's confidence. The actress said: \"He [Lee Daniels] puts together incredible roles for Black women, fully fleshed out characters, layers. And I just I love working with him; he\u2019s family. The actress thought she might not be able to portray such a difficult character, but representing Black women and Lee Daniels' goal became one of the reasons why she accepted the role. Day also explained that she was convinced to play Ebony in The Deliverance as it was important to highlight the woman's legacy and let her story be known to everyone. She added: \"It was working very, very closely with Lee, working very closely with Patrick Smith as well, my acting coach. \" Day explained that her character is deeper than anyone can think. Ebony wants everything to be good when she's struggling from the inside and is hesitant about expressing her fears. Andra Day helmed the role, and she did justice to Ebony Jackson, making her an impactful character in the film. Glenn Close breaks down her character in The Deliverance Shortly after The Deliverance came out on Netflix, people started sharing a clip of Glenn Close on social media. In the scene, Glenn looks terrifying. With heavy makeup, dark black eyes and fanged teeth, she says the words: \"I can smell your nappy p---y\". And it wasn't long before it went viral. One fan tweeted the clip with the caption: \"Lee Daniels you will pay for your Crimes for having Glenn Close say this\". The clip has since been viewed 9. 2 million times with people losing it over how wild it is. Reacting, someone replied: \"Nothing and I mean not a damn thing could\u2019ve prepared me to hear her utter those words. \" Another wrote: \"See I knew this movie was from the devil.

This is something of a surprise, considering heroes are typically outnumbered by their villains, but what's offered as of now is a good selection. Interestingly, despite all the Joker henchmen, Harley Quinn takes a precedent in most marketing over the Clown Prince of Crime\u2014a reflection of her incredible popularity in recent times. On the subject of modern interpretations, Black Adam's design includes DCEU elements. He also took a marketing precedent over Shazam, appearing in the game's trailer despite its Justice League focus.

Possible adult charges for teenage suspect On Tuesday, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said police were investigating aspects of the teenager's background that could change the disposition of the charge that would lead to the teen's case being transferred to adult court. Following Wednesday's hearing, Dunlap said he didn't think transferring the case to adult court was warranted. \"Well, I'm certainly hoping that they don't do that. I think that my client certainly should be treated as a juvenile. He is a juvenile,\" said Dunlap. \"It's very rare for transfer to occur. This is obviously a serious case, a shooting. In the normal course of events, this would not warrant transfer. I hope it doesn't in this case. \"I'll say this, too. \u201d Goudreau attorney Marissel Descalzo said her client was never in hiding and was at all times in contact with investigators through another lawyer representing him in lawsuit filed against a one-time adviser to Venezuela's opposition leader he says hired him to explore the possibility of a mercenary raid. Previewing an argument likely to be used at trial, she said classified evidence will show Goudreau was texting with \u201chigh levels of the government\" in the runup to the raid, leading him to believe the U. S. was on board with his actions. While the administration of then-President Donald Trump made no secret of its desire to see Maduro gone, there is no evidence U. S. officials blessed the invasion or the export of weapons in violation of U. S. arms control laws. The DA\u2019s office did not respond to an email from KSAT seeking comment on the dismissal Wednesday. Read more reporting on the KSAT Investigates page. The special counsel's office said the updated indictment, filed in federal court in Washington, was issued by a grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. The new grand jury has only heard this new information. Sources familiar with the matter tell Fox News that discussions surrounding the superseding indictment will likely not speed things up, and it is unlikely it will go to trial before the November election. Fox News' David Spunt and The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u201cIf I were put in his shoes, I would've gotten out of Dodge way before an indictment,\u201d Judge Virginia Hernandez Covington said in ordering Goudreau's release pending the scheduled start of his trial next month. Goudreau, shackled at the legs in orange prison garb, responded \u201cnegative\u201d several times when asked in court whether he had ever been diagnosed with mental illnesses that would make him a risk to himself and others upon release. Although the 48-year-old has no criminal record and was a three-time Bronze Star recipient in Iraq and Afghanistan, Assistant U. S. Attorney Cherie Krigsman argued that Goudreau was a flight risk with a track record for manipulating witnesses who knowingly violated U. S. laws. Krigsman said Goudreau fled to Mexico, where he stayed about a year, within days of learning he was under investigation. Prior to departing the U. S. Pearsall will miss at least the first four games of the regular season after being placed on a non-football injury reserved list. \"He's going to need that time physically. He's going to need that time emotionally, mentally, and we made that decision,\" said Lynch. \"When we drafted Ricky, we did it for the long term, and Ricky's going to be a fantastic player here. \" Lynch told reporters it was \"by the grace of God\" that Pearsall was back with the team so quickly.

The same day the woman\u2019s DWI case was dismissed, a DA staffer wrote in judicial dialog notes that he had spoken to CH (then-First Assistant District Attorney Christian Henricksen) and JG (District Attorney Joe Gonzales) about the case. \u201cWe all agree that the case should be dismissed. D (defendant) was very helpful in a HT (human trafficking) case that resulted in prison time for that defendant,\u201d the staffer wrote, making an apparent reference to Jackson\u2019s prison sentence.

She pointed out during the hearing before Judge Jefferson Moore that SAPD officers entered the hotel room and subsequently searched it without a warrant. Body-camera footage played in court during the hearing shows an SAPD officer removing a gun from Jackson soon after entering the room. Officers then questioned the teen in the room while she sat and cried on a bed, the footage shows. Officers found multiple guns in the room. The teen said Jackson had taken her phone and that she had been in an escort service for about a month, the footage shows. \u201cFrom the beginning of this case I think that there was illegal search and seizure issues from the start. And I don\u2019t think they (SAPD) did a real, proper investigation,\u201d Wentland told KSAT in March. 15 during an unrelated February 2021 crash off of Culebra Road. The woman crashed into a San Antonio Fire Department ambulance at the intersection of Les Harrison Drive and Culebra Road, SAPD records show. She was unable to recite the alphabet at the scene, stated she was too drunk to be driving, and was later hospitalized for a large cut on her forehead, records show. Five people in all were hospitalized following the crash, records show. A blood alcohol analysis completed by a Texas Department of Public Safety lab in April 2021 showed the woman\u2019s blood alcohol content was. 21, nearly three times the legal limit to drive a vehicle.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is ready for the regular season, especially after what turned out to be an eventful training camp. Getting up to speed with a new offense, missing two weeks because of a foot injury, and then being stuck in an elevator for two hours the night before a game in Dallas made the preseason more exciting than it needed to be. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fun test. I definitely learned a lot and went through some things you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Herbert said on Wednesday as Los Angeles continued preparations for its opener Sunday against the Las Vegas Raiders. Herbert said the injury to the plantar fascia in his right foot was an accumulation of stress on the foot during offseason practices and training camp rather than one specific play being the reason. \u201d \u201cIf we did not have legal issues with that, I would say \u2018yes\u2019, Clemson\u2019s Terry Don Phillips said. \u201cHere, college football supports all of our other sports.

Whether general manager Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll would survive a season that leads to a top pick isn't clear. The Giants don't want to accept another poor season, but the constant turnover in those roles isn't helping either.

Hygiene and pickles during periods It is important to take special care of hygiene during periods, as the risk of infections and diseases increases at this time. In ancient times, cloth was used to maintain hygiene. Nowadays, modern sanitary products are available to take care of health related hygiene. Pickles and health Fact: Pickle juice can actually help reduce menstrual cramps. Pickle juice contains a good amount of electrolytes like sodium and potassium. These electrolytes can help reduce muscle cramps. Some researchers believe that when pickle juice touches the back of the throat, it can relax the muscles and reduce cramps. Believe me, I watch a lot of tape of college QBs, and they're college QBs. They do dumb stuff. Nico looks like an NFL veteran. He gives me the kind of vibes I had when watching guys like Andrew Luck, Trevor Lawrence, Joe Burrow and Caleb Williams. Yes, this weekend's opponent will be a far more difficult test than Chattanooga was, but I have full faith in Iamaleava. It doesn't hurt that the rest of this Tennessee team is pretty good, too! As for the Wolfpack, last week's performance against Western Carolina wasn't impressive, but I try not to read too much into bad games in the first week of the season. Plenty of good teams have opened the year with stinkers, and that could prove to be the case with this Wolfpack squad. I expect the Gamecocks will try to play with pace in this spot but won't be successful enough to do so. It's much more likely Kentucky will take command and go boa constrictor on the game clock.

The Hawkeyes aren't likely to set scoring records this season, but I believe the offensive improvements are legitimate.

Regarding ABC airing the proposal, she said she knew it was coming. \u201cThey walked me through the game plan and everything,\u201d Tran explained. ABC aired the pre-taped proposal footage after Tran talked about Strader ending the engagement. He was on stage awkwardly sitting next to her as it was shown to viewers. \u201cIt completely invalidated our entire relationship,\u201d Jenn told her former fianc\u00e9. \u201cI failed you, and there\u2019s nothing that I can say other than that, you know, but everything I felt was real,\u201d he responded.

Social media users criticized the show\u2019s producers for making her relive the emotional moment on live television. \u201d He added, \u201cThe words that people have passed around with no validity, just hear-say has beaten me up to no end. You\u2019re an incredible man and I hope everyone who has ever doubted that, gets a chance to know the real you like I have. \u201d.

Devin then in turn decided to propose right back and got down on one knee with a beautiful Neil Lane engagement ring. It would have been great if that was the beginning to Jenn's happily ever after, but now we know it was the beginning of the end. After the cameras stopped rolling, Devin apparently began to struggle with his feelings. Jenn said that he ghosted her and became more distant. He even cut off communication between her and members of his family. It's not been the brightest of starts to the season for Everton, who have lost each of their three Premier League fixtures, the last of which stung keenly, letting a late two-goal lead slip. Indeed, despite winning 2-0 at home to Bournemouth, having played with confidence and style, Everton inexplicably capitulated and the Cherries lashed in three strikes to send the atmosphere at Goodison Park spiralling through the floor. It cast a black blanket over an already disappointed fanbase, having lost 3-0 and 4-0 to Brighton & Hove Albion and Tottenham Hotspur previously, but there were positives to take from last weekend's result. Sean Dyche and his Toffees team have been mired in the trenches before, and with Dominic Calvert-Lewin fit and firing, they might just have the firepower to shoot away from the relegation fodder this season. \u201d She told Glamour, \u201cI was very, very anxious that night and so my emotions were just all over the place from the beginning. \u201d Tran cried as she talked with host Jesse Palmer about the situation, and cried heavily as the proposal aired. \u201cIt was a very hard thing to do to watch it back with him,\u201d Tran acknowledged. However, she added, \u201cI also knew that it needed to be done because I wanted him to watch that part. \u201d Tran went on to explain why she wanted Strader to watch the proposal. \u201cHe just says things all the time and I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s been watching everything back and really listening to the words he\u2019s been saying. \u201d She added, \u201cHis apologies have been so nonexistent. \u201cHe was checked out. It wasn\u2019t what he wanted anymore. \u201d While Jenn claimed that she fought for their relationship, she claimed Devin had no interest in pursuing couple\u2019s counseling. \u201cWe left Hawaii engaged,\u201d Jenn said through tears. \u201cI thought I found the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. As soon as we left Hawaii, things were different. \u201d Related: Relive Bachelor Nation's Craziest Endings Ever So much for their happy ending!

Over the weekend, she appeared at the Netflix special \"Joey Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef\" without her wedding ring, marking her first public appearance since Chigvintsev's arrest. Fans quickly noticed the missing ring, fueling speculation about the state of her marriage. Just days later, she was seen boarding a private jet to Las Vegas with her son, again without her ring. John Cena pidi\u00f3 matrimonio a Nikki Bella en el ring A history of high-profile relationships Bella's relationship with Chigvintsev followed her highly publicized romance with WWE star John Cena, which ended in 2018. Bella and Cena were one of WWE's power couples, having gotten engaged at WrestleMania 33 in 2017. However, the relationship ended less than a year later due to their conflicting views on starting a family. However, it\u2019s still not as egregious as sexual infidelity. In this case, the question of harm in secret keeping becomes especially complex. The harm from keeping a secret about sexual infidelity is threefold. First, the perpetrator will experience the burden of guilt as they keep the infidelity secret from their partner. Second, their partner will feel the pain of betrayal if the infidelity is revealed. And third, whether the secret is kept or revealed, the relationship itself will suffer. If the perpetrator keeps the secret, feelings of guilt will bleed into the relationship, and the other partner will sense that something is wrong. And if they reveal the secret, their partner may well decide to abandon the relationship altogether. But even if they decide to stay, the relationship is harmed, perhaps irrevocably. And if you can internalize me and take me with you into your various areas of your life where you need some of that input, then I have done something meaningful. Here\u2019s one thing I say in the tour, and I say it in the courses too: Relationships are stories. What I would like to invite you to do is to consider your stories with a new curiosity, with more nuance and ambiguity. I want you to think about what are the parts of your story, relational and sexual story that you want to keep and develop further, and what are the parts of your relational story that you want to leave behind or change?

(Photo credit: Clare Grant/Courier Journal / USA TODAY NETWORK) Ranked in the Top 25 in September for the first time since 2020, No. 22 Louisville looks to continue its strong start on Saturday at home against Jacksonville State. The visiting Gamecocks were favored in last week's opener against Coastal Carolina, but coach Rich Rodriguez's team turned the ballover three times, allowed 552 yards of total offense and dropped a 55-27 decision at home. On the flip side, the Cardinals were heavily favored at home last week and decked Austin Peay 62-0, allowing just 106 yards of total offense. \"(It's) a great opportunity for our players be in a great venue against a really good team,\" Rodriguez said. Check all the medal winners of yesterday HERE. \u201cWe would then have to pay all athletes. \u2026 There could be a problem with lawsuits. Philosophically, that is not what we are here to do. We are here to educate. At the end of the day, if we pay players, then we are no different than a professional franchise. \u201d Antitrust lawsuits are the primary reason college athletes can be compensated for their names, images and likenesses (NIL). Moreover, a proposed consolidated settlement of three such challenges, commonly known as the House case, would usher in a 10-year model in which schools would be permitted to share as much as $22 million annually with their athletes. Though no AD would have quite envisioned such a model 20 years ago, some were amenable to the concept, including Virginia\u2019s Craig Littlepage, now a senior advisor at the search firm Collegiate Sports Associates. With a preseason ranking just inside the top 60, our voters were not overly down on Boston College, but clearly the win has leveled the Eagles up a tier to the discussion for top-30 to top-40 status. No. 27 Clemson (-13): If our voters are gathering unanimously around Georgia at No. 1, there's probably a high floor for how far Clemson was going to fall after losing to the Bulldogs.

Now, I don\u2019t say that with this game, but I do think this game has Playoff consequences, and that\u2019s good enough. \u201d Once the only in-state rivalry pitting teams from different major conferences, the Cy-Hawk is fueled by a mixture of friendly wagers and modest hate. Each campus\u2019 fraternities and sororities display large derogatory signs about the other, and one rarely can scroll through a social media platform in the state without encountering some level of trash talk. Particularly in the Des Moines area, every office building, school, church or neighborhood includes a mix of fans of both teams. Iowa State allowed 174 yards on the ground against North Dakota, while only running for 86 of its own. Iowa also has a strong secondary that should be able to at least limit the Cyclones' passing attack and take some of the explosiveness away from receivers like Jaylin Noel and Jayden Higgins. As long as the Hawkeyes can limit glaring errors, they've got a good chance of winning a tight one. O/U pick: Under 62. 5 points Under 62. 5 points The Rebels and their opponents went over 62. 5 combined points in five of 13 games last season. The Blue Raiders\u2019 games last season had a combined scoring total higher than 62. 5 points in four of 12 outings. The two teams combined to score 59. 4 points per game last season, 3. 1 fewer points than this matchup\u2019s total. Opponents of these teams combined to average 50. 6 points per game last year, 11. 9 fewer points than this matchup\u2019s over/under. Rebels matchups last season had an average total of 58. 9, 3. 6 fewer points than this game\u2019s over/under. The Blue Raiders had a 52. 5-point average over/under in their matchups last year, 10 fewer points than this game\u2019s total. The Hawkeyes are considered a College Football Playoff at-large contender. The Cyclones have that possibility, too, along with Big 12 championship potential. Should the teams achieve their postseason goals, this result will carry weight with the CFP selection committee. Even if they fall short, the outcome could impact their conference\u2019s at-large resumes. \u201cThis feels like it\u2019s worth so much more,\u201d said CBS analyst Gary Danielson, who will call the game with Brad Nessler. \u201cThis data point will be huge for both of those teams. I don\u2019t suspect that either one of them will go undefeated. So this data point is almost like an ending data point that we might be looking at between Notre Dame and USC at the end of the year.

At a school that ranked either No. 1 or No. 2 in Princeton Review\u2019s annual party school rankings from 2012 through 2016, it\u2019s obvious what kind of lather will brew in Iowa City, especially with a projected high of 69 degrees and no rain. \u201cThere\u2019s always a buzz,\u201d Iowa linebacker Jay Higgins said. \u201cSure, the guys on campus, they probably get more excited for the game than we do with all the signs and stuff you\u2019ll see on social media. \u201d The anticipation flows on the field, too.

Sept. 5, 2024. Key Takeaways The Minecraft Movie trailer has dropped, and fan reception is already not looking good. With Jason Momoa and Jack Black at the helm, the star power is strong, but many feel the film lacks meaning. The art design has been relentlessly mocked, and many are disappointed in the movie's depiction of this beloved franchise. The Minecraft Movie trailer just dropped, and most fans seem to agree. It looks bad, and long-time Minecraft fans are worried that the gaming Goliath is next on the movie-to-game adaption chopping block. At this point, the game-to-movie adaptation trend is like a game of Russian roulette, either destroying your favorite gaming franchise in the public's eyes, like with the disaster of Borderlands, or bolstering it to even further critical acclaim. Miners, get ready! A Minecraft Movie is coming to theaters in 2025. Minecraft, a video game for ages 10 and up, skyrocketed in popularity following its release in 2011. Having sold more than 300 million copies worldwide, according to Hypebeast, it is now the most popular video game of all time. The game's main objective? Build, explore, and interact, with players being able to choose their own adventures. The upcoming A Minecraft Movie will have a similar premise. The film follows \"four misfits\" \u2014 played by Jason Momoa, A Good Girls Guide to Murder's Emma Myers, Orange Is the New Black's Danielle Brooks and up-and-coming actor Sebastian Eugene Hansen \u2014 who are pulled into the Overworld, a \"bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. \" Napoleon Dynamite writer and director Jared Hess is at the helm of A Minecraft Movie. - @ I10Podcast_AJD reject modernity (billy), embrace tradition (bj) - @ emma_chapple BABY BOP'S BROTHER'S NAME IS \"BJ\" NOT BILLY - @annemeownie It turns out I'm not the only person on the internet who was shocked that \"BJ\" is now \"Billy,\" as plenty of people made the fact that they're bothered by it known.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Expand INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The Sparks can only hope they get the chance to see Paige Bueckers do for them what Caitlin Clark is doing for the Indiana Fever. Clark became the fastest player in WNBA history to reach 100 3-pointers in a season and finished with 24 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for her second career triple-double as the playoff-bound Indiana Fever beat the last-place Sparks, 93-86, on Wednesday night. Clark made her second 3-pointer of the game and 100th of the season midway through the third quarter and added two more to reach 102 and finish 4 for 10 from long range. The No. 1 overall draft pick is the first rookie with 100 3-point baskets. Aliyah Boston had 24 points and 14 rebounds for the Fever (18-16), who secured a playoff spot Monday night when Atlanta and Chicago lost. Indiana has won five straight for the first time since 2015 and is 10-1 at home since June 1. Odyssey Sims had 20 points and six assists to lead the Sparks (7-26), who are going to have a good chance to land the top pick in next spring\u2019s WNBA draft \u2013 widely expected to be Connecticut star Bueckers. Dearica Hamby had 16 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals, while Rae Burrell added 16 points for the Sparks, who have lost five in a row on the road and are 2-15 away from home this season. Azura Stevens had 13 points and 11 rebounds and Kia Nurse added 13 points. Clark made two free throws with 16. The Sparks were able to cut the Fever lead to three points on multiple occasions down the stretch but could not get any closer. Indiana pulled away on the free-throw line in the closing minutes thanks to some clutch free throws and this timely Boston bucket, which was courtesy of Clark's 10th assist of the evening. It's been an incredible run for the 18-16 Fever, now winners of five straight and seven of eight. The entire team has been firing on all cylinders, with Clark, Boston and Kelsey Mitchell (18 points) leading the way. As for Wednesday, it was simply another amazing performance from Clark, who got her first triple-double on July 7 in an 83-78 win over the New York Liberty (19 points, 13 assists, 12 rebounds). \u201cShe\u2019s just always consistent. Always consistent with getting extra work in. You can count on that. \u201d For Mitchell, her 7th year as a Fever marks her first postseason berth, and she\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s not interested in going back to losing basketball. \u201cI know what the bottom feels like,\u201d \u201d Mitchell said, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be there no more. \u201d.

Ten of his cases resulted from positive tests for Clostebol that were traced to Trofodermin; nine of those resulted in bans, Fontana said in an interview Thursday. \"When an athlete tests positive for Clostebol, the first thing I ask them is if they used Trofodermin,\" Fontana said. \"And if they haven't, I tell them to go check if a family member or partner has, because it's transmitted so easily. \" Sinner was not suspended for his positive tests after it was determined the Clostebol entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi. Sinner said his fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara, purchased Trofodermin in Italy and gave it to Naldi for a cut on Naldi's finger. Clostebol is listed in the anabolic androgenic steroids section on page 5 of WADA's 24-page list of banned substances. And \"Clostebol\" appears four times on the Trofodermin box and can bought by the AP (the product is also available as a cream).

Though Jones also won that first start, with 336 yards passing and touchdowns on the road against Tampa Bay, he and the Giants struggled through his first three years. His breakthrough in 2022, which included an NFL-best interception rate and only eight turnovers in 16 games with a career-high 708 rushing yards and the first win by the Giants in the playoffs in 11 seasons, prompted a four-year, $160 million contract that put him among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Addison has game-breaking speed and is coming off an impactful rookie year. He also has one of the top offensive minds on his side in O\u2019Connell and a quarterback coach in Josh McCown who is one of the best communicators in the league. If Darnold can get some support from his offensive line and new running back Aaron Jones, he should be in an excellent position to succeed in the opener. The Vikings allowed former quarterback Kirk Cousins to leave through free agency and first-round draft pick J. J. McCarthy tore his meniscus in the team\u2019s first preseason game. As a result, they need Darnold to show that he is a legitimate NFL starter who can perform under pressure. His first test is Sunday as Week One kicks off in the NFL. He needs to pass that test with flying colors. Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones were swiftly dumped into the deep end of NFL debuts, shouldering heavy pressure as young quarterback in the country's largest media market. As is often the case in this sink-or-swim league for players at the sport's most demanding position, the results have failed to match the high hopes raised by their heralded arrival. In what could well be their last chance to convince the league they can still be capable starters for years to come, Darnold and Jones will lead their teams into the same season opener Sunday when the Vikings visit the New York Giants. Whatever the outcome, it likely won't bode well for the loser. Travis Kelce, Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown (once he returns from injury) are far more likely to earn consistent targets. Worthy's ability to turn the targets he does receive into big plays, however, are going to keep him in the flex conversation all season long. Speaking of Rice, he was Mahomes' top target on the evening (seven catches for 103 yards) and sure looked like a potential WR2 in PPR leagues going forward. Assuming he remains eligible to play the entire season, he could be primed for a breakout year. The other major fantasy star on the night was Baltimore tight end Isaiah Likely, who may have just surpassed Mark Andrews as the top receiving option at tight end for the Ravens.

It\u2019s a much different story in the 17-game NFL season. Teams can overcome losses at the start of an NFL season to earn a playoff spot or even a championship but losing the opener can set a brutal tone for any team that is not a championship contender. The Minnesota Vikings are not championship contenders as they start the season. They appear to be a team that is going to finish fourth in the NFC North.

If that opportunity comes, I would very much be open to it,\u201d he explained. For now, the 42-year-old is content with his role at the San Diego Wave. The team\u2019s location and community involvement make it a perfect fit for his personal and professional life. However, his long-term vision undoubtedly includes higher-profile positions, such as leading the national teams on the world stage. Skepticism over USMNT\u2019s coaching choices While Donovan is eager to see the American national teams succeed, he has voiced skepticism over the U. S. Men\u2019s National Team\u2019s recent hiring decisions. Mauricio Pochettino will most likely take charge of the USMNT, but Donovan remains cautious about how the Argentine coach will fit into the team\u2019s dynamics. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Donovan added, \u201cWe have seen over the last decade-plus\u2014a big name means nothing. \u201d While the ex-striker holds Pochettino in high regard, he is concerned that the success of the team will depend on much more than just having a prominent manager on the sidelines. \u201cI think [Pochettino] is a very good manager, but we just don\u2019t know how that\u2019s all going to gel together,\u201d he added. If there was a precise moment when Kevin Kilbane knew his old friend was destined for the top, it came in 2016. Lee Carsley had been travelling from his home in the English midlands to stay at his former Everton and Republic of Ireland teammate\u2019s house in Manchester after being named as Manchester City Under-18s coach a few months earlier. \u201cIt was probably the best youth team I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Kilbane says. \u201cI used to go and watch them on a Saturday morning and I could see the relationship he had with players like Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho and Brahim D\u00edaz. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is a big pull from within the England camp to get him the job permanently. \u201cShe\u2019s such a great player, really tough opponent. \u201d Sabalenka will play the winner of a match between Jessica Pegula and Karolina Muchova in the championship match. Navarro beat her on the hard court in three sets at Indian Wells this year and the pair looked to be in store for another big battle as they traded breaks early in the first set. But the Belarusian calmed her nerves and wrested the momentum in the sixth game, getting the critical break with a forehand winner before extinguishing Navarro\u2019s break point chance in the seventh with an unreturnable serve. Navarro bloodied her knee midway through the second set chasing a shot and Sabalenka looked ready to cruise to victory when the American helped her to a break with a backhand error in the fifth game. No. 6 seed Jessica Pegula advanced to her first ever major Grand Slam after a 1-6, 6-4, 6-2 win over Karolina Muchova on Thursday night. The full battle at Arthur Ashe Stadium lasted over two hours. \"It comes down to really small moments that flip the momentum,\" Pegula said. \"I came out flat but she was playing unbelievable. She made me look like a beginner, I was like about to burst into tears because it was embarrassing. She was destroying me. \" Pegula will be facing No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka on Saturday, which will be a rematch of the Cincinnati Open title match in August. Muchova seemed in control during the first set, which lasted just 28 minutes.
